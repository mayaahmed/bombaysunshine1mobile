<h3> Chapter 1 </h3>
<h2>A Sister's Wedding</h2>
        
     

<p> Tara came back from school.  She saw a short and fat man
  sitting in the hall and eating pancakes. He was glaring at
  her. She placed her bag down and shouted </p>

<p> "Mummy, I am hungry." </p>

<p> Then she looked at the  man again. He was looking at her
  from  head  to toes.  She  stared  back  at him  in
  defiance. He continued  to scrutinize her as though
  she  was  a  museum   piece.  Tara  found  the  man
  annoying. She  made a face at him.  He was shocked.
  Tara enjoyed  the man's discomfort and  so she made
  all sorts  of faces at  him. As soon as  Tara heard
  her mother down the hall she sat straight. </p>

<p> "Is this the girl?" the  man asked Tara's mother.</p>

<p>  "No" said Tara's  mother. "She  is my  younger daughter
Tara. Manda is not back from work yet." </p>

<p>  "Well, what about her? She will do fine" the  man said.</p>

<p> "Oh, No. She is very young.  She is still in school." </p>

<p> "Is she eighteen?" </p> 

<p> "No, she is just fifteen. Tara, Go keep your bag in place." </p>
         

<p> Tara went inside. Her mother followed her. </p>

<p> "Who is that man?" asked Tara. </p>

<p>"He is the marriage agent" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p>"The way  he looks  at girls one  would think that  he is
         looking for a bride himself" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Hush girl. He may hear." </p>

<p> Tara's  mother served  her pancakes and  chocolate milk.
         Tara was always very hungry when she came back from
         school. Her  mother went back to the  hall and Tara
         followed. Curiosity was  getting the better of her.
         Her mother  had told  her recently that  she should
         not go to the hall when strangers came over. </p>

<p> "What the hell?" Tara said to herself. "This is my house." </P>

<p> Tara sat on a couch so she could see the marriage agent properly. </p>

<p> "How much can you give in cash?" he was asking. </p>

<p> "Five Lakhs. The rest in jewelry"  Tara's mother said. </p>

<p>  "Well, then  I  cannot  find a  doctor  groom for  her.
         Doctors do not come below ten lakhs." </p>

<p>  "The maximum we can offer is five lakhs." </p>

<p> "Okay. I  will see what I can do. Let  me see the bride.
         If she is pretty, we may do better." </p>

<p> Just then Manda walked in. The agent ogled at her and said
  "Let me see what I can do."  He continued eating his
  pancakes. </p>

<p>  "This girl could do very well. You are sure she is not eighteen yet?"
         he asked as he was leaving. </p>

<p> Tara  wanted to make a  face at him again  but since her
         mother was watching  she gave it up as  a bad idea.
         After a  week the marriage agent  returned with two
         women who were a prospective groom's sisters. </p>

<p> "Where is the groom, mummy?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "He will  not come in the first  round of negotiations"
        Tara's mother explained.  "We have to settle certain
        things first." </p>

<p> "Then how come they can see Manda. They should see you and me." </p>

<p> "Tara, you are too young. You do not understand a lot of
        things. Now keep quiet.  I have lot of work to do." </p>


<p> Tara watched the two women from behind the curtains. Both the
        women wore a lot of gold ornaments and wore silk saris. </p>
        
<p>  The agent entered the house to talk to Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "These are nice people. If they like the girl, she is very lucky."  </p>
        
<p> "Why, are they going to marry her?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "Take care of this girl. If she keeps chattering like this no
        one will marry into this house" the agent said half jokingly
        and half seriously. He was beginning to enjoy Tara's company. </p>

<p> Tara's mother made chicken pulao for them. The whole house was
smelling of delicious food. Tara watched them from behind the
curtains.  The agent was obviously hungry. The party had come early
and lunch could not be served till noon. He was forced to sip bitter
tea while he fantasized about the pulao.</p>

<p>  It was  time to  introduce Manda  to the  guests. Manda
       looked beautiful in a lavender sari as she served tea
       and then  sat down coyly.  She did not  initiate much
       talk. The women were scrutinizing her. They asked her
       lots of questions. When  the lunch was finally served
       the agent proved his gluttony beyond doubt. The women
       did  not make any  promises when  they left  but said
       that they will get back to them soon. </p>

<p> After two weeks the groom came. He was a dandy. A young
        executive called Ajit with immense confidence. Manda was shy
        and she looked down when she answered him. Tara did not like
        the dandy at all. She knew he will take Manda away from
        her. Looking at Manda's face she could see that now her
        sister's goose was cooked. </p>

<p> After that day her sister lived in a kind of trance. Tara
        would see her talking to Ajit's photograph. Tara shared the
        room with Manda. She did not like the change in the attitude
        of her sister.  Ajit and Manda would talk for hours on the
        phone. They would go out most evenings.  Tara hardly got to
        talk to her sister.  And when they talked it would be mostly
        about Ajit. </p>

<p> Now, Tara had worked for weeks on an elocution piece
                for a school competition, and she won second
                prize. Tara was very happy and when she told Manda
                about it, Manda just said, "Oh congrats. By the way
                today I am going to the beach with Ajit." </p>

<p> "To hell with Ajit. To hell with your beach" said Tara and
                she left the room. </p>

<p> When Ajit came home that evening he met with a scowling Tara.
        He had no idea what brought that on. </p>

<p> "Want to come with us to the beach?" Manda asked Tara. </p>

<p> "No. I want to go with you alone" said Tara. "You will have
        Ajit's company everyday once you are married. Why do you both
        have to go out every evening? Damn it." </p>

<p> "Tara, when your time comes, you will know" said her mother
        laughing. </p>

<p> "I am not going to be so lovesick like other people present
        here" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Peace" said Manda. "Tomorrow we will go to the movies.
        Just you and I." </p>

<p> "Can't I come too?" asked Ajit. </p>

<p> "If you ask things like that again, I will follow you every 
        evening, starting from today" said Tara. </p>

<p> Tara and Manda had a nice evening at the movies the next
        day. After wards they went for a walk on Chowpatty and ate
        bhel. Manda knew that this was a special evening. These were
        her final maiden days and soon she would be bogged down with
        responsibilities of married life. They walked together for
        long buying trivialities. </p>

<p> That night after Tara had gone to bed, she sensed her sister standing
        by her bedside and watching her. When she  switched on the light
        she could see that her sister was crying. </p>

<p> "I am afraid Tara" she said. </p>

<p> "I am afraid too, Manda. I am going to miss you a lot" said Tara.
        They both started crying. When Tara's parents came and
        saw the sight they started crying too. Tara's brothers sat up
        in their beds and looked on trying hard to put on a sad face.
        They were obviously amazed at all this sentiment. </p>

<p> "I will make some coffee" Tara said. They sipped coffee and
        talked through half the night. </p>

<p> The morning of the wedding, turmeric and sandalwood paste was
        applied on the body of Manda. She wore a golden yellow sari.
        White jasmine flowers decorated her long black hair. Manda's
        friends applied makeup on her face. Manda's mother had
        collected gold ornaments for her daughter's wedding since the
        day she was born.  Today Manda wore them all. She looked like
        a princess. </p>

<p> Tara was busy taking care of the guests. She welcomed them at
        the door and got them food and drinks. Then she spotted a fat
        old lady.  She was accompanied by the groom's sister and
        sister-in-law. The old lady walked as though the world
        belonged to her. Tara guessed that this must be Ajit's
        mother. The old lady had an expression of displeasure on her
        face. This was the lady's day to be important. After all she
        was the groom's mother. Tara noticed that everyone including
        her own father was obsequious around her. Tara despised the
        lady at first sight. </p>


<p> When the old lady was going into Manda's room, Tara's curiosity
        got the better of her. She forgot her duties as the hostess and
        she followed the lady. </p>

 <p> The lady looked Manda up and down. Manda gave her a slight smile.
        The lady did not return the smile. She checked out the gold necklace
        on Manda's neck. </p>

<p>        "This necklace seems too light" the lady said. "She is
        wearing only twelve gold bangles. That is a shame. My elder
        daughter-in-law had twenty five bangles. People will say my
        daughter-in-law is from a pauper's family."  </p>

<p> "But, I am giving everything as was previously agreed upon"
        said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "Paru, you did a very bad job of arranging this wedding" the
        lady told her daughter. "My son is an executive
        engineer. This is not according to our standards." </p>

<p>  "Manda is very pretty" said a guest. "I am sure she will
        be an asset to your family. Do not worry about what people will
        say. This family is one of the best families." </p>

<p>  "Her picture looked better than her" said the lady. "There
        were so many beautiful girls for my son. I do not know why he
        chose her." </p>

 <p> "The same way his father chose you" said Tara. </p>

 <p> Tara's mother glared at her. The lady turned back and saw Tara.
        Tara had a very innocent smile on her face. </p>

 <p> "Who is this girl with the razor tongue?" </p>

 <p>       "This is Manda's sister Tara"  some one said. </p>

<p>        "I hope Manda is not like her. I do not like sharp girls" the
       lady said. </p>

<p>       Tara was going to reply but Tara's mother intervened and
       said "Tara, go look after the guests. I thought I could rely
       on you. Be a nice girl now." </p>

 <p>      "Yes mother" Tara said and while she was leaving she heard the
       lady say </p>

 <p>      "You should not sweet talk daughters. They sit on your head if you
       do. You should make them obedient." </p>

<p>       Tara got angry but she let it be. She could not understand why
       Manda had to get married into this weird family. She did not
       like anybody. They were acting as though Ajit was doing a
       favor by marrying Manda. According to Tara, Manda had an upper
       hand in the deal for her father was paying the groom five lakhs
       which Ajit would not have made in half his lifetime. </P>

 <p>      The groom's party ate lunch first and then Tara's family and guests.
       After the wedding ceremony, Tara's parents showed the family her 
       dowry. They were giving her silver utensils, fifty saris, grains,
       and groceries which would last at least a month. The groom's family
       had got a goldsmith along. He checked the weight and authenticity
       of the jewelry. </p>

<p>       At last it was time for Manda to go. Manda entered the decorated car.
       The car was decorated with garlands and roses. When a car like that
       was seen on the road, people would peep in to it to see the bride.
       Brides always looked nice with all the jewelry and jazzy clothes. </p>

<p>        Tara looked around her. Her mother's face was drained out of life.
        She never saw her that sad in her life. Her father was keeping a
        brave face. Her brothers were hiding a tear or two. Manda was
        crying openly. And as the car moved away Tara cried too. Her sister
        was gone forever. From now on she would visit them as a guest. The
        five  of them felt a loss which they knew was difficult to overcome. </p>

<p>        Somewhere Tara had heard that girls were guests in their father's
        homes. They had to go one day. Boys were different. Today Tara
        knew what it meant. She could not help wishing that her sister
        should have been a boy. The wedding would have been fun then.
        They would have had a new member in their family instead of 
        losing one. </p>
