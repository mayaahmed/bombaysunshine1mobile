<h3> Chapter 10 </h3>
<h2>Caged bird</h2>
       


<p> Military Uncle was so called because he was from the military.  He
 gave Tara a caged Parrot for her birthday. </p>

<p>"This is a wrong present for Tara" said Jaya. "Tara hates to put
living things in cages." </p>

<p> "I usually do not" said Tara.  "But I really like this parrot. Thank
you very much Uncle." </p>

<p> "Is it just to make me happy that you are telling lies?" asked Military Uncle.</p>

<p> "No, No. This Parrot is pretty. I really like it." </p>

<p> "I am glad you like it. Take good care of it." </p>

<p> When Military Uncle stepped out of sight, Jaya complained </p>

<p> "Tara, you hypocrite. How come you like to put this parrot in a cage?"</p>

<p> "Jaya, Don't you see? I am planning to set this parrot free. If I told
Military Uncle I do not like this parrot he will give it to someone
else.  May be he will return it to the shop. I want to give this
parrot its freedom." </p>

<p> "Good idea" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "I like the parrot" said Tara's little brother Chintu. He did not like the
idea of losing the parrot. </p>

<p> "You can still like the parrot when it is flying in the sky" said
Tara. "I hope they have not cut its wings." </p>

<p> Tara checked the parrot's wings by spreading it out.</p>

<p> "It's wings are okay" said Tara. "I need to check whether it can fly
next." </p>

<p> When Military Uncle came back he saw that everyone had gathered around the
cage. The scene made him happy and he said: </p>

<p> "So you are all happy with the bird. Good, good, good." </p>

<p> "We want to see it fly" said Chintu. </p>

<p> "Close all the doors and windows" said Military Uncle. "We will set
it free." </p> 

<p> So after all the doors and windows were shut Military Uncle opened the
cage door and let the parrot out. The parrot flew all around trying to
escape in confusion. After a few minutes Military uncle caught it and
put it back in the cage. </p>

<p> "It sure can fly well" said Jaya giving Tara a meaningful look. Tara
nodded in assertion. </p>

<p> "Here give the parrot a guava" said Military Uncle to Chintu. Chintu
really enjoyed watching the bird eat. </p>

<p> "Here give it a chilly" said Military Uncle. </p>

<p> "Vow! This parrot eats chillies" said Chintu happily. </p>

<p> Chintu sat and watched the parrot with wonder in his eyes. </p>

<p> Just then a group of parrots flew above Tara's house. Parrots always
flew making a lot of noise. The parrot in the cage shrieked loudly and
tried to break free desperately. </p>

<p> "This parrot is talking to his friends"  laughed Military Uncle.
"Ha, ha, ha. What a loud noise he makes!" </p>

<p> "I need to set it free" whispered Tara to Jaya. "Must do it
secretly. This Uncle will hate me if he finds out. My mother might get
angry too because I wasted Uncle's money. Need to find the right
time." </p>


<p> After a couple of days Military Uncle went away for a short visit to
another house. When her mother was not looking Tara smuggled the cage
to the terrace. Chintu and Jaya came along too. </p>

<p> "Let us set it free" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I like the parrot" said Chintu sulking. </p>

<p> "Yes Chintu. I like the parrot too. But it is not nice to put it in a
cage. You know only bad people get put in jails. Even in jails they
put people together. Only the worst and the most dangerous criminals
are put in isolated cells. That is almost the worst punishment people
have devised over hundreds of years. Why  punish this parrot? What did
it do? It's only fault is it's beauty."  </p>

<p> "I like the parrot" repeated Chintu.  </p>

<p> "If you like the parrot really and truly then you will want what is best
for it. You will want it to be happy. That is why we must set it free."  </p>

<p> "That is what you came here for today?" asked Chintu.  </p>

<p> "Yes. We will set this bird free for that is where lies it's
happiness. Among it's own kind with it's family and friends."  </p>

<p> And Tara took the bird out of the cage and set it free. The parrot
flew away and sat perched on a tree. But soon a few crows started
bothering it and chasing it around. The parrot flew around in
confusion.  </p>

<p> "Oh no" said Jaya. "I hope the crows don't hurt the parrot." </p>

<p> Every one got a little tensed. </p>

<p> "I hope this Parrot will be okay" said Tara. </p>

<p> Luckily a group of parrots flew overhead and the parrot joined the
group a little clumsily at first trying to keep pace and soon it
learned to fly gracefully and there was harmony. </p>

<p> The little group on the terrace were happy and Tara said </p>

<p> "Mission accomplished." </p>

<p> Later Tara went and put the cage back quietly in its place. When
Tara's mother came and saw the empty cage she exclaimed: </p>

<p> "Oh no! The parrot escaped. Your Military Uncle will think that you
were careless about his present. I guess there is nothing we can do
about it though. The bird is gone." </p>

<p> "May be you can replace it with another bird?" asked Chintu. </p>

<p> "Uncle will be back tomorrow" said Tara's mother with a shrug. "I do
not have time for parrot shopping. He might as well face the truth." </p>

<p> "I like parrots" said Chintu. </p>

<p>  "If you want to see parrots, look up in the sky when they fly" said Tara.
"A bird can fly so let it fly. It must be cool to fly." </p>
