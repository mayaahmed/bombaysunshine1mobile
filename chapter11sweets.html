<h3> Chapter 11 </h3>
<h2>Sweet nothings</h2>
       
<p> Tara's elder brother Babu usually helped her with her math and physics
problems. He quickly saw the solutions to the problems that Tara spend
hours worrying about. </p>

<p> "How do to do this problem?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Easy. Write this equation and solve it." </p>

<p> "Yes. Now why did I not think of it?" </p>

<p> Tara felt very dumb. After sometime she went and asked Babu about
another problem. </p>

<p> "You do not know the answer to this?" asked Babu. "This is easy." </p>

<p> He explained the solution to the problem. </p>

<p> Again when Tara went with another problem to Babu he said </p>

<p> "How come you do not know the answer to this? You must think a little
harder."  </p>

<p> He began explaining how to solve the problem when suddenly Tara felt
very dumb. She sat down and cried. Her brother felt very bad and he
tried to cheer her up. He sang a popular Hindi song: </p>

<p> "Phoolon ka taaron ka, sub ka kahna hai, <br/>

Ek hazaron mein meri behna hai." </p>

<p> The song meant that the flowers and stars say that my sister is one in
a thousand. The singing cheered Tara up and she smiled.  </p>

<p>"I did not mean to hurt you" said Babu.  "You must think more. That
is all I said." </p>

<p> "Yes, I was being silly" agreed Tara. </p>

<p> Tara's mother came in and said:</p>

<p> "Babu, here is a little job for you. You are studying to be an
engineer. My blender is not working. Can you fix it?" </p>

<p> "They do not teach me to fix blenders at my school." </p>

<p> "What, you cannot fix a blender?" asked Tara's mother. "Then how can
you build bridges?" </p>

<p> "I am not going to build bridges. That is a civil engineer's job. I am
a Mechanical engineer." </p>

<p> "If you cannot build bridges at least fix my blender." </p>

<p> Tara's mother was a little surprised by the fact that her son was not
going to build bridges. </p>

<p> "I will see what I can do" said Babu. </p>

<p> "All that education and you should be able to do at least something
that is of practical use to your mother" said Tara's mother. "Now I
will have to grind the masala on the stone." </p>

<p> "I will do it for you ma" said Tara. "I love grinding on the stone." </p>

<p> Tara ground the masala for her mother while Babu tried to fix the
blender. As luck would have it Babu actually managed to fix the
blender.</p>

<p> "Your blender is working now. It just had a loose wire in it" said
Babu. </p>

<p> "Now I can believe you are a true engineer" said Tara's mother.

<p> At dinner Tara asked her dad </p>

<p> "Papa, Is the curd curry tasting different today?" </p>

<p> Her father guessed that the curry had something to do with Tara and
said </p>

<p> "Yes, It tastes better than usual. I was wondering why it is tasting
so good." </p>

<p> "Tara ground the masala on the stone today for the curry" Tara's
mother said. </p>

<p> "No wonder, it was tasting so good" Tara's father said. "Give me
some more of the curd curry." </p>

<p> Tara knew that this was a game, but she liked this game. She was happy
that her father said the right thing. After some time a group of kids
came to Tara's door. </p>

<p> "Do you want to play cowri, Tara didi?" asked Mani.  </p>

<p> "Sure" said Tara.</p>

<p> "Don't you have anything better to do?" asked Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "What can be better than playing cowri?" asked Tara laughing.</p>

<p>She went outside and drew squares with a chalk on the veranda
floor. It was like a game of dice but now they threw sea shells
(cowri) to get their moves and they used broken pieces of glass
bangles of different colors to make their moves. They played for a
while.  But suddenly in the middle of the game the lights went off. </p>

<p>The children started screaming. Children always screamed when the
lights went off. </p>

<p>"You kids are howling like street dogs" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> Tara's mother brought a lamp out for Tara and her little friends. They
made some shadow animal figures on the wall for some time and soon
they got bored. </p>

<p> "Let us tease dabba" said Mani. </p>

<p> All the other kids agreed. So they began shouting in the dark </p>

<p> "Dabba is an idiot. Dabba is a fool. Dabba go away." </p>

<p> Tara found the whole thing funny. She tried to stop them but she
could not do much. They continued bombarding Dabba with insults. Poor
Dabba's only fault was that he was not with this crowd at that point
of time. After sometime Dabba came out and shouted </p>

<p> "Dabba is great. Dabba is a king. Others are barking dogs." </p>

<p> This was like adding fuel to the fire and so the group of kids
intensified their insults. But suddenly they heard the angry voice of
Dabba's mother: </p>

<p> "Who are these hooligans? Why are you insulting my son? What did he do
to you?" </p>

<p> The kids did not wait to reply to that and they said </p>

<p> "Didi, we better slip off before the lights come back. Dabba's mother
will kill us if she catches us. We will play cowri some other time." </p> 

<p> They all ran off to their homes in the cover of darkness. </p>
