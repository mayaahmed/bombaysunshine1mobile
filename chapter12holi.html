<h3> Chapter 12  </h3>
<h2>The festival of colors</h2>
        

<p> Seeta had to go to the market to buy vegetables. Jaya and Tara decided
to give her company. </p>

<p> "Tomorrow is Holi" said Jaya. "We better avoid the main road. Let us
take this little road to the market. That way we can avoid people from
putting color on us." </p>

<p> "Sounds like a good plan" said Tara. </p>

<p> So Jaya, Tara, and Seeta took a little road to the market. But
suddenly they were bombarded with water balloons. </p>


<p> "These people who live out here are pros" said Seeta. "Hardly any
misses. My head is hurting."  </p>

<p> They ran all the way out to the big road. But the bombardment did not
stop till they got to the clear road. </p>

<p> "You were avoiding water and color" said Seeta. "Of all brain dead
ideas this is the worst." </p>

<p> "It is not Holi yet" said Jaya. "It is not legal to throw balloons
today. I cannot believe the people who live in this street behave like
this. We should complain about them to the police." </p>

<p> "I must say we were caught by surprise" said Tara laughing. "That
was unexpected. But then that is what makes Holi fun. To catch others
by surprise. If we were in their boots we would be laughing a lot now." </p>

<p> "Come to think of it, it was funny" said Jaya. </p>

<p> Jaya was feeling a little stupid for suggesting to take that street. Seema laughed a lot when she saw them.</p>

<p> "You girls are all drenched. What happened? Did it rain from where you
came from just now?" </p>

<p> "It rained water balloons" said Tara.</p>

<p> "Oh you fools" laughed Seema. "You got hit by water balloons? Even
before Holi? Ha, ha, ha. Morons." </p>

<p> "It could happen to anybody" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "Fools" said Seema. </p>

<p> Seema then took the road that Tara and her friends just left.</p>

<p> "Should we tell her about the perils of that road?" asked Seeta. </p>

<p> "Of course not" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "Surely not" said Tara.  "We are the fools here not her, remember." </p>

<p> "It will be fun to see her face" said Jaya.</p>

<p> "Let us catch up with her from the other road" said Tara.</p>

<p> "I do not want to miss this" said Jaya.</p>

<p> So the girls took another road and they waited at the exit of the
little road for Seema to show up. They ran all the way to get to the
exit before Seema could reach there. When Mala saw them running she
asked</p>

<p> "What are you people doing?" </p>

<p> "We are waiting for Seema" said Tara. "Wait along if you want to see
some fun."</p>

<p> "Sure" said Mala. "Anything for a couple of laughs is my motto." </p>


<p> As luck would have it the residents of that street after their success
with Tara and her friends got encouraged to go further and they had
buckets full of colored water now to greet Seema instead of just plain
water balloons. So when Seema came out from the  street it was
hard to recognize her. </p>


<p> "Let us act as though we do not recognize her" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "That is a fun idea" said Tara. </p>

<p> "We saw Seema go through that street and she has not emerged yet"
Jaya told Mala loudly. "We are very worried about her."  </p>

<p> "Jaya, I do not see why you are worried" said Tara. "Seema is not
foolish. She can take care of herself." </p>

<p> "Let us ask this lady whether she saw Seema" said Mala.</p>

<p> Tara then asked  Seema "Dear lady, did you see a smart girl on that street?" </p>

<p> "Stop it you fools" said Seema angrily. "Do not try to be funny." </p>

<p>  "She must have met Seema down there for sure" said Jaya. "It seems
like she already knows we are fools." </p>

<p> "I know since we got so foolishly hit by water balloons Seema must be
doing something clever out there" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Seema can do nothing clever" announced Mala. </p>

<p> "I second that" said Seeta. </p>

<p> This was too much for Seema. She saw a hose nearby and she drenched
everyone with it. Every one picked up a hose each and indulged in a
water fight. </p>

<p> "Holi hai (It is Holi)"  shouted passersby.  </p>

<p> After some time Mala decided it was quite enough. </p>

<p> "I am out of here" said Mala running away. </p>

<p> Seeta thought the same. </p>

<p> "Let us go to the market and get the vegetables" said Seeta.  "My
mother will kill me otherwise. She is waiting for the tomatoes to make
Sambhar for dinner." </p>
 

<p> So they went to the corner where there were a few sellers sitting on
the streets and had vegetables on a jute cloth. Tomatoes, potatoes,
green chillies, and other things were separated into small piles on the cloth. </p>

<p> "Seeta, you get your tomatoes" said Jaya. "I am going to buy myself
some jasmine flowers for my hair."  </p>

<p> So while Seeta was buying vegetables, Tara and Jaya bought garlands of
flowers. Suddenly a man came running and warned: </p>

<p> "Pack up. Pack up. Municipality's gaadi (vehicle) is here." </p>

<p> "Hurry up" said the flower seller. She took the money and piled her
basket and ran away. </p>

<p> The vegetable sellers did likewise. </p>

<p> "I got my tomatoes" said Seeta. "My mother would have scolded me
otherwise."</p>

<p> The municipality vehicle was full of vegetables, fruits, and other
goods that were snatched from sellers. It stopped where Tara was
standing and some men got out and snatched whatever they could from
sellers who did not manage to make a good escape. Some sellers escaped
very well. </p>

<p> The municipality vehicle send terrors in the hearts of the vegetable
sellers. It was illegal to sell on the roads. One could only sell in
licensed shops. But licensed shops were impossible to buy or rent in
Bombay. It was very expensive for anybody and these were really poor
people. </p>

<p> "Poor people" said Tara. "So much loss. It is sad that poor people
have to face more loss than the rich. Societies are made to make the
rich richer." </p>

<p> "Hmmmmmm" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "Have you noticed that the rich buy expensive shoes that last longer?
The poor cannot afford shoes that are expensive and they buy cheap
shoes that break easily. The poor spend more money on shoes than the
rich without wanting to. These poor vegetable sellers simply cannot
afford this loss. It is devastating on their economy." said Tara. </p>

<p> "Hmmmmm" said Jaya. </p>


<p> "True, but tomorrow this market will form again" said Seeta. "These
same people will sell on these same roads again."  </p>

<p> "Life teaches survival skills" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Hmmmmm" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "Also I do not see the point" said Tara. "These sellers have to sell
on the streets or face starvation. This is their only means of
livelihood. I do not see the point of the Municipality vehicle grabbing
their goods." </p>

<p> "May be it discourages them and they will look for other means of
livelihood" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Maybe. But I doubt if there are any alternatives at this point for
them. Maybe in future it will get better."  </p>

<p> "Hmmmm" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "It seems like Jaya got hit badly by the water balloons" said
Seeta. "She is hmmmming all the time."  </p>

<p> "Such is life" said Jaya finally. </p>

<p> "Hmmmm" said Tara and Seeta. </p>
