<h3> Chapter 13 </h3>
<h2>Shopping around </h2>
        

<p> A Bengali sariwalla (sari seller) came outside Tara's door and called
out "Sari walla. Bengali sari walla." </p>


<p> He carried a big load of saris on his shoulders. </p>

<p> "I do not want any saris" said Tara's mother. "Ask him to go away,
Tara."  </p>

<p> When Tara asked the sari seller to leave he insisted </p>

<p> "Ask your mother to take a look. I have brought a real good collection
this time.  I will not go away till she has taken a look." </p>

<p> It was now Tara's mother turn to send the sari seller away. </p>

<p> "I absolutely do not want to buy any saris. I am sure. Please stop by
next time."  </p>

<p> "Yes, yes. Do not buy any.  But please take a look at what I have got. I will
not charge you money for looking." </p>

<p> "No, No. I have no time. Please go away" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "I will only show you the best saris. This will not take time.
Do not buy any. If you like a sari, I will save it for you till next time.
Now just take a look."  </p>

<p> The sari seller then spread a white cloth on the floor outside Tara's
door. He then opened the bundle and started spreading pretty cotton saris on
the white cloth. </p>

<p> Soon a little crowd of women had gathered outside Tara's house
and the Sari seller spread more and more saris out for everyone to see. </p>

<p> "Just take a look" said the seller. "I will not charge money for 
people to take a look.  Do not buy if you don't want to." </p>

<p> Soon there was a pile of saris on the floor and most women had
bought at least one sari each. Tara's mother bought two and when the
sari seller left Tara asked her mother with a grin </p>

<p> "You were not going to buy any saris today? What happened?" </p>

<p> "Oh, these Bengali sari sellers. They always manage to convince you
to buy" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> The sari seller had moved to the floor above and Tara could hear him
say </p>

<p> "I will not charge you for looking at the saris. Do not buy if you
don't want to. Just take a look." </p>

<p> "I think the Bengali sari seller convinces because he does not say buy
buy buy" said Tara's mother. "He says do not buy if you don't want to.
Hence people think that they have a free will and they
are buying only if they want to. In fact they are buying when they
do not want to. Completely off season buying of saris this was."  </p>

<p> "Also these Bengali cotton saris are so pretty and elegant and also
reasonably priced" said Tara. "Not too hard to buy them I say."  </p>


<p> "Yes. Bengali saris are very pretty" said Tara's mother. "That
reminds me Tara that Jaya's cousin is visiting from America and she
wants to go shopping. Jaya asked me to tell you to join them for a
shopping trip tomorrow morning." </p>


<p> Next day Tara met Jaya's cousin Anita and Anita's friend Michelle. </p>

<p> "Another of Jaya's girlfriends" exclaimed Anita. "Jaya has so many
girlfriends."   </p>

<p> "Well, this is a friendly country you know" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "How come you people do not hang out with boys? Don't you have any
boy friends?" asked Anita.  </p>

<p> "We have friends among boys but our real friends are usually girls"
said Tara. "If you want to go for a movie or something like that then
we need girlfriends."  </p>

<p> "You people go to movies with girls? In our country people will
think something is wrong with you" said Anita.  </p>

<p> "Well, that is the way it is here" said Tara a little angry and not
wanting to go shopping with Anita anymore.  </p>

<p> Jaya sensing Tara's mood went and whispered </p>

<p> "Do not mind her Tara. You must come along so that I have some
company." </p>

<p> "Okay. Where are we going?"  asked Tara. </p>

<p> "I will take them to the silk palace. Before that we will go to the
local market and the local temple. These people want to see the real Bombay
it seems and not the touristy place. So let us show it to them" said Jaya
with a grin. </p> 

<p> "Let us take them to Dharavi then" said Tara now feeling really naughty. </p>

<p> "No. They have seen plenty of the poor India in pictures" said
Jaya. "Now we will show them the middle class India." </p>

<p> So Tara, Jaya, and the tourists went to the little local market and splat
stepped Anita on cow dung. </p>

<p> "That is called cutting a cake here" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> "Ooh, I stepped on shit" said Anita and she wiped her boots on the
grass nearby. She found a tap and washed her shoes. But that was a
wrong idea because it was a muddy road and her wet shoes got covered
in mud. All this was funny but Anita's reactions were what provided
real mirth. </p>

<p>  "Ooh, this mud. Ooh my shoes. Chee this road" went Anita from
time to time. Michelle on the other hand was quiet and curious
and she was looking around taking pictures and asking intelligent
questions and Tara found her interesting. </p>

<p>  Michelle was curious about the spices in the sacks in the shops
and she kept asking </p>

<p>  "How do you use this spice? What curry will you use this spice for?" </p>

<p>  Tara and Jaya did not know much about cooking themselves and they felt
real bad that they were not of much help. They asked the shop keeper
whether he knew anything about how to cook the spices. He said he had
a wife at home and so he never had to do any cooking himself and he
only sold spices and never used them. </p>

<p>  When they reached a local temple Michelle stopped and studied the
door and wanted to know how old it was.  Tara asked the priest
how old the door was. He did not know and he only said </p>

<p> "It is a very old door." </p>

<p> "It is interesting that there are so many temples of worship everywhere.
That is probably why they call India spiritual" said Michelle. </p>

<p> Anita was miserable with her muddy shoes and she was walking slowly behind
concentrating only on her shoes and her face looked such a picture that
Tara finally felt sorry for her. </p>

<p> "Let us buy a pair of shoes for Anita" said Tara. "We can leave her
shoes with the cobbler to get it polished. We will pick it up on our
way back." </p>

<p> "Let us eat pani puris after that" said Jaya. </p>

<p> The girls agreed to the plan. When they reached a pani puri shop Jaya
explained: </p>

<p> "This shop is one of the good shops for pani puris. But the real good
pani puris are not sold in shops. They are sold in the road stalls.
But since you are visitors we will not advice you to eat from the
stalls. This shop is more hygienic and the pani puri here is almost as
good as the stall puris." </p>

<p> "Since we have never had pani puris before we will not know the
difference" said Michelle. </p>

<p> The Pani puri seller gave everyone a plate. He would punch a hole
in each puri and fill it with chick peas and tamarind water with
a little sweet chutney. He would distribute it as soon as it was
ready. The girls would then pick it up and put it in their mouth
with the water dripping onto the plate and in the end one would
drink the water in the plate. </p>

<p> "You can ask him for more sweet chutney if you like" said Tara. </p>

<p>  "No. This is just perfect" said Anita whose spirits had considerably
lifted with the new shoes and eating pani puri. Michelle's eyes were
watering because pani puri was a very spicy dish. But she relished it
all the same. </p>

<p>  The pani puri wallah stopped after giving everyone six puris and
asked </p>

<p>  "Do you want more?" </p>

<p>  "Yes. half plate more" said Jaya and so everyone had three more
puris each. </p>

<p>  "That was an experience" said Anita really happy with the pani puris.
Michelle was a little thrilled too. She had never tasted anything like
pani puris before. </p>

<p> The girls then went to the gateway of India and hung around the sea
side watching the ships and boats for sometime. They saw a Parsi lady
throw raw meat for crows. </p>

<p> "What is that lady doing? Why is she throwing raw meat for the crows?"
asked Michelle. </p>

<p> "Some religious thing related to death and rebirths. I am not sure"
said Tara. </p>

<p>They also saw a tall man handcuffed and standing on a police jeep. A
huge crowd had gathered around him.  He was dressed in white and he
stood proud like a king. He was also surrounded by police. </p>

<p> "Who is that?" asked Michelle. </p>

<p> "That must be a local gangster" said Tara. "The police is doing this
to him to reduce the fear and respect the common people have of him." </p>

<p> "I know this gangster" said Jaya. "I read about him in the papers.
He has a particularly good standing in this locality. The common
people go to him for quick justice. If there is a drunkard husband or
a cheating neighbor this man brings justice in a jiffy with a couple
of punches. It is the irony of life. The law breakers bring law to common
people." </p>

<p> "A well known gangster with a good standing among the local people is
unheard of in America" said Anita. </p>

<p> "This is Bombay" explained Jaya. "All sorts of things happen
here. We ask no questions unless absolutely necessary." </p>

<p> "The rule number one taught to a child growing up in Bombay is to not
poke your nose in other people's affairs" said Tara. </p>

<p>"Even the thieves and gangsters have a law here. If you leave them to
do their work in peace, they will let you do yours" said Jaya. </p>

<p> Tara said </p>

"Bombay is best described in this Hindi song. <br/>

Seene mein Jalan, <br/>

Aakhon mein toofan sa kyon hai? <br/>

Iss shahar mein har shaks pareshan sa kyon hain? <br/>

Which means  why is there a fire in the heart and a storm in the eyes? <br/>
Why does every person in this city look so troubled?"  </p>


<p> "It must be the small houses and the hot humid weather. It is a tough
life here in Bombay" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "But more than that, Bombay is a city of dreams" said Anita. "Most
people seem detached from their surroundings in some way and their
eyes are seeing nothing of what is around them. The eyes are distant
maybe dreaming of a oasis or something." </p>

<p> "People of Bombay dream big" agreed Tara. </p> 


<p> But if Tara and Jaya showed a few surprising things to Anita and Michelle
around Bombay, soon Anita and Michelle would surprise them in return. 
It happened in the Silk palace shop. </p>

<p> "Give me three meters of that cloth. Yes, give me three meters of that
cloth. That is nice. Give me three meters of that too, ..." went Anita
and Michelle in the silk shop. </p>

<p> Tara was shocked at this buying spree and she asked </p>

<p> "What will you do with all that silk?" </p>

<p> "This is so cheap" said Anita really excited. "I will give this to
my friends in America.  Ooh! This is so cheap." </p>

<p> The buying spree continued. </p>

<p> "Give me three meters of this cloth. Give me three meters of that
cloth." </p>

<p> "Boy! Even for our weddings we do not buy so much silk" said Tara to
Jaya. </p>

<p> "It is our culture to not buy so much silk" said Jaya trying to be
broad minded but visibly shocked herself.  "We like to choose and buy
for special events. But these people are from another country. It is
okay for them to buy that much silk I guess." </p>

<p> The sales people in the little silk shop were very happy and busy. Today
was big commissions day for them. After an hour the two tourists had
bought so much silk that they had to hire a cab back home. </p>
