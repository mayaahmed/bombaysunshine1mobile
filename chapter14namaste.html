<h3> Chapter 14  </h3>
<h2> Namaste </h2>


<p> "My Grandfather is visiting from Madras" Jaya said. "Come in and
say hello." </p>


<p> Tara entered the house and saw an old man sitting on an arm chair. He
had a very traditional look about him as though he was the embodiment
of culture. Somehow greeting him with a Hi or Hello seemed
inappropriate. Tara decided a Namaste was more appropriate for this
occasion. </p>

<p> "Namaste uncle" Tara said bringing her palms together. </p>

<p> Jaya's Grandfather smiled brightly. He usually was very elusive but he
and Tara became instant friends. From then on whenever Tara visited,
Jaya's grand father would tell her all about what Madras was like
fifty years ago, about the Indian Freedom Struggle, and other oddities
from his memory. Tara liked to listen to his tales. He was a bit hard
of hearing so Tara had to write down in a notebook all her questions
and he would then say something about it. </p>

<p> "My grand father is impressed with you" Jaya said. "He keeps saying
that you are the nicest friend that I have Tara. I think he is
impressed because you said Namaste when you first met him. That makes
him think you are very traditional and nice." </p> 

<p> "Maybe it is the Namaste" Tara replied.  "Maybe it is just mutual
liking. I like your grand father too." </p>

<p> "I think it is really the Namaste. No one says Namaste nowadays. So
from now on if I want to impress an elder person I am going to greet
them with a Namaste." </p>

<p> "I will do that too" said Tara laughing.</p>

<p> There was a lot of truth in Jaya's observation. After that whenever
Tara or Jaya were introduced to anyone new they would put on a sweet
smile and say "Namaste" with folded palms.  And this worked like
magic. It did not matter what they did or said after wards. The newly
introduced people were convinced that they were meeting truly cultured
girls. </p>

<p> This would have been great strategy forever if all the people in India
were Hindus. But this was not the case. India had people from many
other cultures too. And when the festival of Id came along Jaya and
Tara had lunch invitations to Ali's house. </p>

<p> "Are you going to Ali's house for the Id lunch?" Jaya asked Tara. </p>

<p> "No. I have to go somewhere else. Are you going?" </p>

<p> "Yes" said Jaya. </p>

<p> "Have fun" Tara said. "I wish I was going too. Id lunches are so
much fun. I like the way how two people share a plate of curry and the
roti (bread) comes from a basket. It is so quaint." </p>

<p> When Tara met Jaya again she asked </p>

<p> "How did the lunch go?" </p>

<p> "Boy, did I get in to trouble!" Jaya said. </p>

<p> "What happened?"  </p>

<p> "When Ali introduced me to his Muslim family, I folded my palms
together and said Namaste. They thought I was a fanatic Hindu and that
I was an old timer. They asked Ali how come he had friends who were so
old fashioned. It was very embarrassing." </p>

<p> "Yes, in that crowd if you had bend your head and said Salaam you
probably would have been a hit. Otherwise, a simple Hi or Hello would
have been better. It is funny how  people judge you by the way you
greet them." </p>

<p> "When in Rome do as the Romans do" Jaya said.  "If you do not know
what they do, wait till you find out what they do." </p>

<p> "That is the new extended proverb for us" Tara agreed laughing. </p>
