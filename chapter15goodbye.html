<h3> Chapter 15  </h3>
<h2>Farewell good friend</h2>

<p> The academic year was ending soon and so would high school. Big
changes were going to happen in Tara's life. Jaya moving out of Bombay
would be among them. </p>

<p> "I will be going to Madras at the end of this semester" Jaya declared. </p>

<p> "For a visit?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "No, for good. My father decided to take a transfer.  We are moving
out of Bombay for good." </p>

<p> Tara was a little shocked. </p>

<p> "Is it possible that you will be going away? I thought you were an
integral part of my life. We are friends for so long now." </p>

<p> "My father thinks we need to go to our roots and understand Tamilian
culture." </p>

<p> "I am going to miss you. I can tell you everything I think. Now what
will I do?" </p>

<p> "I will have to make new friends too. I wonder what the people in
Madras are like. I am sure I will not be able to talk to them at
all. Let us devise a secret code. If we have any secrets we will write
it in codes. I guess we can still remain  good friends by writing
letters."  </p>

<p> "Yes, let us do that" agreed Tara.  </p>

<p>  They had a number for each alphabet and they made two copies of the
code they developed.  </p>

<p> "If we lose this paper then exchanging secrets is impossible till we
meet again" Tara said.    </p>

<p> And soon Jaya left Bombay. Tara felt sad and she sulked around the
house. Tara's father observed her mood and said:  </p>

<p> "People have to go away, Tara. People even die. It is better you learn
to live with that fact early. All these people you are with now need
not be there with you forever. Even I and your Mother will not be with
you forever. You must learn to make new friends and cherish old
friends all the time."  </p>


<p>  "I am learning that quite well'' Tara said.  "I have been
thinking. Where are all the people from my past now? Only a handful
seem to be around. We are like water molecules in a stream. Some
molecules flow with us longer than others. But the continuous flow is
what makes life dynamic and interesting."  </p>

<p> Tara felt poetic and she wrote down in her diary: </p>

<p>   "Title: By The Flickering Light Of The Memory Flame. <br/> 



Every time my mind flies to the past <br/>

All I want to do is get back here fast. <br/>

Memories are haunting happy or sad, <br/>

It is better they fade and never come back. <br/>

I want  to look forward and forward alone, <br/>

Looking back makes me feel mainly alone. <br/>

Where are the people who crowded my life? <br/>

Do I want to make them come back? <br/>

Some of these people were larger than life, <br/>

Today they are just shadows of the memory flame. <br/>

Meeting them now  is never the same, <br/>

Only thing that would not change is their name. <br/>

If today were yesterday,  I would just cry, <br/>

Yesterday was not everything I would have wanted to stay. <br/>

But ever so often I grumble and sigh, <br/>

and  wish I could tell today good bye." </p>
                                       

<p> Tara felt better for a moment after she wrote the poem down. The next
minute she was sad again. So she continued in her diary: </p>

<p> "Philosophy is for the brain. Feelings are for the heart. The heart is
unrelenting and it will not listen to the brain. The brain is a slave
of the heart. Boy! What a mess." </p>
