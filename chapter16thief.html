<h3> Chapter 16  </h3>
<h2>The Thief</h2>

<p> After Jaya left Bombay, Tara did not feel like leaving home much. She
spend a lot of time at home reading books. Other people were not as
much fun as Jaya. </p>

<p> "Go and visit a friend" Tara's mother said. "It seems like you
have hardly gone out of the house this whole month." </p>

<p> "No. I want to finish this book I am reading" said Tara. "It is
summer vacation and I want to just do nothing."  </p>

<p> Tara loved the long summer days. There was nothing to do. Somehow
everything seemed to be quieter and she could hear sounds of children
playing from a distance. </p>

<p> "Tara, you must get some fresh air or you will catch dust" Tara's
mother said laughing. </p>

<p> Tara did not budge from her desk. But soon Seema turned
up at Tara's house. They both went out and stood in the balcony.   </p>
 
<p> "These long lazy summer afternoons are awesome" said Tara. "They
seem so extended in time. These vacations always appear as just one
long single day."  </p>

<p> "I get bored" Seema said. </p>

<p> "I do not know how people get bored. There is so much to do. Life is
so short. Also I love doing nothing." </p>

<p> "That way you can be sure you will never be bored. Because doing
nothing makes you happy." </p>

<p> "Yes, doing nothing  makes me the happiest" Tara said laughing. </p>

<p> The girls soon spotted the bangle seller walking on the road. He
carried a large rectangular box on his shoulder. The box displayed
many colorful glass bangles. Tara was in a mood to buy bangles. Before
she could call out to the bangle seller Charu did. </p>

<p> "Bangdi walla (Bangle seller), come here"  Charu called out. </p>

<p> The Bangdi walla looked up and he slowly decided to go to the floor
where Charu was. He walked slowly. He was in no hurry about anything
it seemed.  Charu lived three floors below Tara's floor. </p>

<p> "Let us go down and buy some bangles" Tara told Seema. </p>

<p> They soon reached Charu's floor. The bangle seller's box had rows of
glass bangles of different colors.  The bangle seller took out a lot
of bangles from the box and handed it over to Charu and Tara. He also
displayed a lot of bangles on the floor. Tara was afraid that she
would break the bangles. She picked up a few bangles and placed it
back carefully. The bangle sellers of Bombay were genuinely nice
natured men and very polite. </p>

<p> "Beti (daughter), do you want to buy any bangles?" The bangle seller
asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Yes" Tara said. "But I am not able to decide. All
these bangles are so pretty." </p>

<p> That only  made the bangle seller take  out more bangles
from his box. Finally, Tara decided to buy twelve leaf green
bangles with  gold designs. Then  she got greedy  and bought
twelve more. Glass bangles were very cheap to buy. Tara wore
them all and said </p>

<p> "I love these glass bangles. I love the sound they make." </p>

<p> It was not a waste of effort or time for the bangle seller to display
his wares. Soon a little crowd of women had gathered around him and
the bangle seller stayed on the floor for a good hour. He lingered
even after the last customer left for any possible last minute sale
before he got back on the road. </p>


<p> Tara's mother was amused to see all the bangles Tara was wearing. </p>

<p> "You are wearing so many glass bangles?" asked Tara's mother.  "You
look like a villager. No one will say that you are going to school and
getting educated." </p>

<p> "It is vacation time" Tara replied. "It is okay to wear them." </p>

<p> Seema did not like all this excitement about glass bangles. She warned
"It will break and hurt your hands. Then you will know." </p>

<p> Tara then knocked her bangles together and sang a popular Hindi movie song: </p>

<p> "Bindiya chamkegi, chudi khankegi.. (which meant the bindiya will
shine and the bangles will knock and make noise)." </p>

<p> "Silly girl" Tara's mother said laughing.</p>

<p> "Silly girl is right" said Seema shaking her head and raising her
eyebrows in contempt. </p>

<p> Suddenly they heard shouts from the street </p>

<p> "Chor, chor, chor, ...."  </p>

<p> Chor meant thief in Hindi. When they looked outside on the road, they
saw a man run with all his might. A crowd of people chasing him
shouting "chor chor."

<p> The chasing crowd grew larger every second. People poured in from
every corner of the street to chase the man. Soon, Tara saw the man
fall, the crowd pounce on him, and then she saw nothing of him. But
she heard the most pathetic cries from the fallen man. It was a
monotonous cry for help.  He was helpless and in real pain. The crowd
was hurting him real bad. </p>

<p> "They caught a robber" Tara's mother said. </p>

<p> Tara could feel the pain in the man's cries and her eyes watered. She
felt like helping him but she knew there was nothing she could do. She
went into her room and tried to shut the sounds off. After some time
her mother came in and said </p>

<p> "It was a thief. In Bombay if a thief is caught he is maimed for life." </p>

<p> "Why can't they leave it to the police to punish the thief?" Seema asked. </p>

<p> "The police lets them go after a bribe" Tara's mother explained.
"The public are angry with the police about that. People want instant
justice."  </p>

<p> Tara was too shocked to talk. </p>

<p> "Don't cry Tara" said Tara's mother. "He is a thief."  </p>

<p> "But he feels pain" Tara said.  </p>

<p> Tara's mother explained:  </p>
<p> "You realize that he pickpockets people's entire salaries. You know
how hard life is in Bombay with everything so expensive. The hard
working people do not like their money being stolen. It enrages
them. The thief knows that he is taking big chances when he decides to
become a robber."   </p>


<p> But Tara could not forget the cries of pain. Late at night she wrote
down in her diary:  </p>

<p> "Human beings are considered by some religions to be the highest form
of life. I do not see that. The higher forms in the animal Kingdom do
not kill for pleasure. Most animals kill only for food. The lower
forms like the wolves kill and pounce on their own kind sometimes for
the pure pleasure of it. Even snakes in cages do not kill the mice
offered to it as food till it is hungry. Sometimes the mice is known
to attack the snakes in fear but the snakes do nothing. The people who
were punishing the thief derived great satisfaction in kicking a
fallen man. The human society is cruel to every living thing including
its own kind."  </p>
