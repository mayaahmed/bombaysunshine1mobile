<h3> Chapter 17  </h3>
<h2>The many faces of women</h2>


<p> Sarita was a social worker who Tara met to work on a school project
regarding underprivileged children. They became good friends though
Sarita was much older than Tara.  Tara liked Sarita. Sarita was this
no nonsense woman. She was well groomed, beautiful, and looked
intellectual. Sarita tied her hair up high in a bun, wore spectacles,
pretty cotton saris, and a big red bindi on her forehead. She was
vocal about women's liberation and she also worked in an organization
that helped unhappy women. </p>

<p>  "I am going to the passport agent's office" said Sarita.  "I have to
go to Italy. I need a passport. It will take a few minutes. Come with
me. Later we can walk back home together." </p>

<p>  "Okay" Tara replied.  </p>

<p>  Tara and Sarita went to a dingy little passport agent's office. There
were two men and one woman seated at different tables. It was quite a
small office. Sarita went over to the agent's desk and asked </p>

<p>  "Is my passport ready?" </p>

<p>  "I am sorry madam" said the agent. "Your passport cannot be
made. You are married and you have not changed your maiden name." </p>

<p> "I am not planning to change my maiden name." </p>

<p> "Why?" </p>

<p> "Just like that. I like the sound of my name. Sarita Choudhary. It
just sounds so good. I have been called this since birth. I do not see
why I should change my name just because I am married. My husband did
not change his name either."</p>

<p> "But this is tradition ma'am. You need to change your name." </p>

<p> "I am not going to." </p>

<p> "Well, then I cannot help you. You will have to go to court and get an
affidavit that you want to keep your maiden name. Only then can we
get your passport issued. Sorry ma'am." </p>

<p> "Why do you want to keep your maiden name?" the only woman in the
office asked a little peevishly. "Are you westernized?" </p>

<p> This woman somehow felt morally superior to Sarita. </p>

<p> "No" said Sarita.  "I am not keeping my maiden name because I am
westernized. Western women change their maiden names after marriage
too. This is what I want to do." </p>

<p> "Such ideas are dangerous to Indian culture. We have such an old
culture. We should be proud of our culture."  </p>

<p> "Women changing their maiden names after marriage is an universal
culture.  Hence I am not threatening Indian culture alone." </p>

<p> At this point the agent decided to  shut off the office lady. He said </p>

<p> "Madam is right. You are right madam. Please bring your affidavit if
you want your passport." </p>

<p> But the office lady continued undaunted: </p>

<p> "We must be proud of changing our names when we get married. An Indian
lady is proud of her husband and her husband's name." </p>

<p> "She is not threatening culture" the man who was silent so far said.
"It is her personal choice to keep her maiden name."   </p>

<p> The agent quickly agreed. He did not want his customers to be
 harassed with ideology. </p>

<p> "Yes, yes, madam is right. You are right madam. You really are right
madam.  Please bring affidavit." </p>

<p> "I will get the affidavit" said Sarita. </p>

<p> When they left the office, Tara said </p>

<p> "It is weird. It seems like the men supported you but the woman was so
against what you are doing. It should be the other way." </p>

<p> "That woman was more honest than the men" said Sarita. "She really
was curious. She found something different and she wanted to know
more. The men obviously already formed an opinion exactly as the woman
did but they did not care to discuss it. They would have, if I
mattered. That is if I was related directly. If their wife or daughter
held an opinion like mine you would have seen a completely different
reaction." </p>

<p> "Are all men then so cunning and out to get you?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "It is not that they are cunning. Their reaction is natural. Before
democracy the kings would have felt threatened if someone believed in
equal rights. The person who believed in liberty would be jailed for
sure." </p>

<p> "But democracy is not necessarily good" said Tara laughing. "Look at
some of our political leaders."  </p>

<p> "It is not whether democracy is good or bad. It is a way of life. Look
at your mother. She takes care of your home. You expect her to be
there when you get back from school. You like her to be just the way
she is. But would you want to be like that?" </p>

<p> "No" said Tara quietly. </p>

<p> "Why?" Sarita asked. </p>

<p> "Because I want to have a career. I want to study. I want to understand." </p>

<p> "You are not alone. Education does this to people. As soon as you
read a few books, you think that you can challenge norms of society.
Just because you are a little educated you like to make noise. You
want to change the world in some way. This is true for all educated
people regardless, whether they are men or women." </p>

<p> "If you put it that way, I feel silly" Tara said. </p>

<p> They stopped at a channawalla's stall. Channawalla's were an
integral part of Bombay's lifestyle. The channawalla sold ground nuts
and channa (chickpeas).  He put some hot coal on the channa all the
time. So the channas were always hot and crisp. </p>

<p> "Give me two packets worth twenty five paise each" said Sarita. </p>

<p> The channawalla made two paper cones and filled it with channa and
folded the top neatly and gave it to them. </p>

<p> "Have you ever wondered why all the channawallas of Bombay have the
same style of selling channa?" Tara asked.  "Why do they have the
same round basket?  Why do they sell the same collection of nuts? Why
do they make the same kind of paper cones? Why can they not do
something different? Like sell channa and mangoes maybe."  </p>

<p> Sarita just shrugged in reply. </p>

<p> "The first channawalla of Bombay must have been a trendsetter" said
Tara. "He must have defined what channa selling should look like." </p>

<p> "Or maybe it evolved in to the present form" said Sarita laughing. </p>

<p> "The paper cones that hold the channa is like a Chinese cookie for
me" said Tara.  "Just like one wants to find out what the fortune is
in the cookie, I like to open the paper cone and figure out the
history of the paper." </p>

<p> "Mine looks like someone's math notes" said Sarita. </p>

<p> "Mine looks the same too" said Tara. "The handwriting is same. So
these two paper sheets came from the same math notebook."  </p>

<p> "Sherlock Holmes?" asked Sarita. </p>

<p> "Deductions not worthy of title" said Tara laughing. "So, you think we
are heading towards an equal society?" </p>

<p> "I do not know" said Sarita. "All that I know is equity is my
personal choice at this moment. More and more women are getting
educated. Parents want their daughters to be educated. Men want
educated wives and so on. When more and more women get educated they
will probably make choices like me. Then we head for an equal
society." </p>

<p> "Or else?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "No one knows" said Sarita. "Dynamics of society are strange. We
must be willing to face change. Now we protest and bring about
changes. Then since we worked so hard to bring change we try to hold
on to the changes we brought about. The young people will want to
change what we did and then we will be the establishment. An
intelligent mind is not afraid of change because it knows that society
is continuously evolving."  </p>


<p> "Somehow I get the feeling that nothing matters" said Tara. "I wish
there was somebody who knew all answers. You look so strong and
confident but even you leave open ends."</p>

<p> "Tara, whenever you are really confused, do what you think is best"
said Sarita.  "It will not drastically alter anything. You can always
make repairs.  I am definitely confident of that." </p>

<p> But the next minute Sarita said

<p> "Well, not really.  If you are a president of some country you may not
be able to make repairs for things you do. Sorry to disappoint you
Tara. I am not a very confident person." </p>

<p> "That is okay" said Tara imitating the Passport agent. "Madam is
right. You are right madam. Please bring affidavit." </p>

<p> "I certainly will" Sarita said and they both laughed. </p>

<p> When Tara got home she saw her mother was busy making papad and
achar. A group of women were sitting around and rolling out
papads. Tara's mother send Tara to Charu's house to ask her to join
the papad making. </p>

<p> When Tara reached Charu's house she said </p>

<p> "Charu didi, my mother is calling you to make papads with other
ladies. Please come to our house" </p>

<p> "I will come in a minute" said Charu. "Let me finish washing my
face first. Come in Tara." </p>

<p> Charu's face was covered with something that looked like mud. </p>

<p> "What is that on your face?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "It is multani mutti. It is good for your face. It makes you feel
fresh." </p>

<p> Charu was almost as old as Tara's mother but Charu looked a lot
younger. Everyone else in the building of Tara's mother's age were
called aunty but everyone called Charu didi (sister).  Charu was also
prettier than most women in the building. Charu's apartment was
furnished charmingly. Not expensively but in very good taste. </p>

<p> "Your house is like an artist's house" said Tara. "The art work
makes it almost look like a museum but at the same time it is so cozy
and comfortable like a home. It is also so fragrant." </p>

<p> "Oh, that is just because I burnt some incense sticks. But I like your
compliments, Tara." </p>

<p> Tara saw some unfinished paintings lying in a corner. </p>

<p> "What is this you are painting?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "That is a picture of Chinchoti water falls in Vashi. Chinchoti is
very pretty in the rains. I have some pictures of the place from our
visit last year. I am using those pictures to paint." </p>

<p> "These are good paintings. You must try to hold an exhibition in
Jehangir Art gallery." </p>

<p> "Oh! They are not all that great Tara. Also I have so much work with
kids and a husband and all that. My Family is my top priority. All
this is just what I do in my spare time." </p>

<p> Charu offered Tara a small garland of Jasmine flowers and she wore a
lot of Jasmine garlands on her hair herself. </p>

<p> "You look very pretty, Charu didi" Tara said and Charu smiled. </p>

<p> When they reached Tara's house Charu got herself a spot and started
rolling out papads. Tara held the flower garland in her hand and
played with it for a long time as she watched her mother and other
women roll out papads and cut green mangoes and lemons for pickle. A
lot of other girls were there too. The young girls helped to put  the
food in the sun to dry. </p>

<p> "Go put this basket of mangoes to dry in the terrace, Tara" Tara's
mother said. "Make sure you place stones on the sides of the paper
before putting the mango slices on it." </p>

<p>  Tara and Raji ran with their baskets up the stairs. They spend a long
 time spreading the mango slices on the paper. </p>

<p> Seema and Seeta were already on the terrace chasing away any birds
that came close to the drying food. The crows and sparrows were a
nuisance to papad and pickle making. Tara and Raji had to go back to
get another batch of food to dry. </p>

<p> "Let us race to downstairs" Raji said. </p>

<p> "Sure, let us do that" said Tara. </p>

<p> While racing Tara fell down and scratched her face against the terrace
wall. When she got back she was bombarded with questions from her mother. </p>


<p> "Tara, how did you hurt your face? It is bleeding. Look at that cut. It looks
like it will leave a permanent mark."  </p>

<p> "Nothing serious" said Tara. </p>

<p> "You must take care of your face" said Charu. "You are a girl. Good
looks are very important." </p>

<p> "Looks are not important to me" Tara said. "I am going to be a
scientist. If I was to be an actress or something then I would worry
about my looks. For a scientist looks don't count." </p>

<p> "It will help you find a good husband" said Charu and everyone laughed.</p>

<p> Tara often wondered about Charu. She had left her first husband and
two kids and now she had another husband and two more kids. She looked
like a perfect wife and mother. She was allowed in company more like a
criminal who was excused because of good behavior but people were
still a little cautious.  </p>

<p> Tara could sense something different about Charu. Charu was not like
Sarita. Sarita was an intellectual rebel. Sarita rebelled because she
wanted to rebel. Charu was a rebel without wanting to be one. Charu
did not brag about being a rebel. Yet Charu was bolder than
Sarita. Charu did not think of consequences and she acted on what she
believed.  Sarita was a rebel who would generate ideas and Charu was
a rebel who acted without ideas.   </p>

<p> Charu did not induce a feeling of respect in Tara like Sarita did but
yet Charu was quite talented. Charu was trying to reach out and get
admiration. Her aim in life was to be a perfect wife and she wanted a
husband who thought she was a perfect. Charu was trying to bring that
aim to life and she was continuously fighting.  She was fighting age
that was stealing her beauty away slowly. She looked like a rose in
a vase whose rims were drying out but it was not yet ready for the
bin.  She was fighting to sustain her husband's initial interest in
her and somehow Charu was fighting a losing battle.  Tara could not
place what it was that was somehow missing in Charu.  </p>


<p> "Mother, Is Charu didi a bad woman?" Tara asked.  "Why did she leave
her first husband?" </p>

<p> "Tara, I don't know whether Charu is a bad woman or not" said Tara's
mother. "But she is not a very responsible person. When you marry, it
is for better or for worse. You are married for seven lives according
to Indian Philosophy. A woman's character reflects on the welfare of a
household. It is a very big responsibility to be a woman." </p>

<p> "And what about  men?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "For men too. Indian society is not good to men who are divorced. A divorced
woman is looked upon more favorably than a divorced man. Tara, isn't it
nice that you come back from school and know for sure that your mother
and your father will always be there for you? There are other societies
where children do not have that security. That is because of this
simple principle that when you marry, you are married forever."  </p>

<p> "Ma. How come you are so sure of everything? How come you know all the
rules of society? How come you have no doubts about anything?" </p>

<p> "I don't know everything child. But some of these rules have been in
society forever. It has been tested by time. If you follow these rules
you will have a better chance at happiness than people who break
rules." </p>


<p> "Why, do you think I will break rules?" Tara asked her mother with a grin. </p>

<p> "Why did  you ask me that?" Tara's mother asked seriously. </p>

<p> "Because none of the set of rules are universal. Take a bunch of rules
you get society one. Take another set of rules, you get society two
and so on. A new set of rules defines a new society."  </p>


<p> Tara's mother laughed and said </p>

<p> "This is not Science. Things are not so simple. The rules of society
are custom made for each set of people around the globe. But dear
Tara, my child, I have no doubts about you. I am sure you will turn
out alright." </p>

<p> "Why?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "Because you are intelligent and also you have a heart. Moreover you are
my daughter." </p>

<p> Tara felt very proud that her mother trusted her so much. </p>

<p> "I am kind, nice, and gentle?" Tara asked pushing her luck a bit
further. </p>

<p> "Of course we still have a lot of work to do to improve you but in time
you will be fine" her mother replied laughing. </p>

<p> Tara's mother went to kitchen and started making Tea. It was three in
the afternoon and it was time for tea. Tara watched her mother. Her
mother was like a pillar of society. People came to her to ask for
advise about everything and whatever her mother said was the last
word. Her mother followed a set of rules fanatically. </p>

<p> One had to wake up at a certain time, One should not let spider webs on
the walls of the house ever, One had to sweep the floors twice each day,
once by the maid and once by the lady of the house and all such rules. </p>

<p> Tara wondered about whether her mother ever question these rules. What
made her mother so sure and certain compared to Sarita? Tara wondered
about other women in her building. They prayed for their husbands and their
children and they were paranoid about their family. These were good
women who knew their minds. Tara later wrote in her diary: </p>

<p> "Why am I so confused about everything? Is it because I live in
Bombay?  My mother was brought up in a village. Villages in India
of course had a variety of cultures but neighborhoods were formed of
people of one culture and faith. So my mother and her friends were
exposed to one set of rules most of the time. But look at my
building. People in every apartment here come from a different part of
India. They speak a different language, they eat different food, wear
different jewelry, and go to different temples. My faith is always
under test. </p>

<p> But my mother is right. It is important to be a woman. It might appear that
women are the lesser of the two sexes. But somehow I know that in my home,
my mother is the important one. All of us do not count. It is okay if my
father is not in the house but if my mother is not there I really miss her
and all of us miss her. Every home is a little solar system and the woman
is the sun in that system. Everyone revolves around her till the daughters
grow up  and become a sun with her planets and the sons go and find their
own suns. Yes, I think it is wonderful to be a woman." </p>
