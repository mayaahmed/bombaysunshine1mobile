<h3> Chapter 18  </h3>
<h2>Bombay Summer nights </h2>

<p> In the summer most people spend  evenings in the maidan outside
their homes. A maidan was an open space where children played in the
evenings usually. But on summer nights, it was a venue for people to
gather as groups. Tara's mother and her brothers were there too along
with their own groups. </p>

<p>  As was the usual practice, this night too, Tara and her friends sat
forming a circle.  Everyone had to do something when their turn came.
They could either sing a song, read a poem, tell a joke or a story.
Tara was the poet so when her turn came she said: </p>

<p>  "Here goes a poem for this pleasant full moon night. </p>

<p> Title:  To the infinite night sky. <br/>

        On full moon nights, <br/>

        The sky beckons you, <br/>

        to soak up the night sky lights, <br/>

        and wait for the morning dew. <br/>

        When the world around you is sleeping, <br/>

        you hear the endless roads of the world calling, <br/>

        and your body seems light and ready for flight, <br/> 

        far, far  away from everyone's  sight."  </p>

<p> Everyone clapped in appreciation. When it was Seema's turn she sang a
 popular Hindi movie song:  </p>

<p> "Mera piya gaya Rangoon

wahan se kiya hai telephone...(which meant my spouse has gone to
Rangoon and he has telephoned me from there)."  </p>

<p> Seeta had recently confided to Tara that she felt like laughing
 every time someone sang. She said that she had a tough time keeping a
 straight face. Seeta was biting her lips suppressing her laughter and
 Tara found the whole situation comic. </p>

<p>Tara whispered to Mala </p>

<p>"Look at Seeta. She is trying to control her
laughter." </p>

<p> Sure enough Seeta's face was all contorted with suppressed laughter.
When Mala burst out laughing, Tara joined too. Thus Seeta was relieved
to laugh openly. Everyone else laughed without knowing why they were
laughing. Seema was a little confused but she joined the common
laughter too. </p>

<p> "Sorry I laughed" said Tara. "It is not you but me. My laughing has
nothing to do with you but Seeta's face was too funny. You must
continue your singing." </p>

<p> Seema continued her singing: </p>

<p> "Mera piya, Mera piya..." </p>

<p> But now no one could sit listening to this song with a straight face.
Everyone  was giggling. </p>

<p>  "I say quits to singing tonight" said Seema.  </p>

<p>  "May be that is a good idea" said Mala. "Let us go cycling. Let us
go and rent some cycles. That will be fun."  </p>

<p> All the girls decided to go cycling. They took permissions from their
parents to go cycling. Then they went to a nearby cycle rental shop
and hired cycles for an hour each. They cycled all around the narrow
streets of their residential colony. After some time they saw a water
truck standing in the middle of the road. People lined up waiting
to fill up their buckets. The girls stopped to watch.  </p>

<p> "No water in the taps for two days in a row" one lady complained to
Tara. "The municipality is providing us water with trucks now."  </p>

<p> "The government should provide us with twenty four hours tap water
supply" said Seeta.  "They do not do that and we have to store
water in pots and drums. Now they do not supply water for
two days in a row. Our government is useless."  </p>

<p> "Luckily our buildings are not affected this bad yet" said Raji. "We
still have a few hours of daily water supply."  </p>

<p> "Water problem is a pain" said Tara. "It is worse in summer."   </p>

<p> Tara watched the water flow from a tap in the truck with awe. Water
trucks were not a common sight. When the girls saw an old lady
struggle with her bucket full of water, they decided to help her.  </p>

<p> "How come you are carrying water aunty?" asked  Seeta.  "Are there
no young people in your house?"  </p>

<p> "My son, his wife, and children have gone on a tour. What to do? One
needs water to live."  </p>

<p> "We will help you carry the water to your house" said Tara. "Where
do you live?"  </p>

<p> "On the third floor" said the lady pointing to her house.  </p>

<p> Tara asked the girls to  carry the buckets in pairs.  </p>

<p> "If one person carries a bucket full of water, it seems very heavy. 
Two people make the weight null."   </p>

<p> "It has something to do with physics and distribution of mass" agreed Mala.  </p>

<p> Tara and her friends carried many buckets of water and filled a little
drum the lady had for storing water.  </p>

<p> "That is enough girls" said the old lady. "This much water is enough
for a couple of days till my son gets back. Even if no tap water comes
this much water is plenty for a old woman like me. I cannot thank you
enough. God send you girls to help me. May god bless you."  </p>

<p> The lady offered the girls some good home made sweets.  </p>

<p> "We can carry another round of water for you for these sweets" said
Tara. "They are excellent."   </p>

<p> "I am glad you like it. Old women like me forget our cooking skills.
I used to make better sweets when I was younger."  </p>

<p> "Sweets cannot get better than this" said Seeta. "Rest assured aunty
that you are still a great cook."  </p>

<p> This compliment somehow made the lady talkative. </p>

<p> "Girls, one should always do their job well. In the scriptures it says...."  </p>

<p> The lady told them a little story from the scriptures. Now Tara and
her friends were in no mood to listen to religious discourses just
then since their cycles were soon due at the cycle shop. </p>

<p> "That was a nice story" said Tara. "We have to go now." </p>

<p> "You liked it? I will tell you another." </p>

<p> The lady then went ahead and told them another story. At the end of
the story no one dared say it was a good story in the fear of having
another story forced on them. </p>

<p> "We have to go now" said Tara. "We have to return our cycles." </p>


<p> "That reminds me of a story from the scriptures of people taking leave..." </p>

<p>  The lady told them a story again. </p>

<p>  "We really have to go now" said Mala. </p>

<p>  "Here is a story..." began the old lady. </p>

<p> But Tara and her friends did not stop to listen and they raced down
the stairs to their cycles. </p>

<p>  "Boy! We must hurry" said Tara. "Our hour is almost up. If we don't
make it in time the cyclewalla will charge us more money." </p>

<p> Everyone cycled to the rental shop in full speed. After the cycles
were returned in time the girls began discussing the plight of the old
woman. </p>

<p> "One should not leave old people alone like that" said Seeta. "Old
people are like children. Think of all the fuss people would have made
if an eight year old was left alone to attend to himself. That old lady
could barely walk." </p>

<p> "I am sure some neighbors are assigned to look after her" said Seema.</p>

<p> "Seeta is right" said Tara. "Assigning neighbors to look after an
eight year old will not be acceptable to society either." </p>

<p> "The world is selfish" said Seeta. "They know that the old people
are of no use but the young will be."</p>

<p> "Law of nature" said Mala. "The old leaves fall to give place to
green leaves. Such is life." </p>

<p> "I really enjoyed helping that old lady except for her stories" said Seeta.

<p> "Me too" said Tara. "I am pleasantly tired. I am going to hit the
bed." </p>

<p> Mosquitoes were a problem in Bombay. Every evening they had to close
all the doors and windows and light a mosquito coil. Otherwise the
mosquitoes would swarm in.  Life was abundant in the tropical climate
of Bombay.  Everything, from people to tiny insects was
overpopulated. Before sleeping Tara tied a mosquito net around her
bed.  Tara got into her bed inside the net with her diary and she
wrote </p>

<p> "In these fleeting moments of time, <br/>

we gather the events of a lifetime, <br/>

These tiny rain drops of joy and sorrow, <br/>

form the ocean of memory for us tomorrow." </p>

<p>  Tara closed the diary and played with the mosquito net for
sometime. She liked the way the net bounced. Later Tara hid her face
in the pillow and slept. </p>
