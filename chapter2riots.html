<h2>Bombay Riots</h2>
        
   <br/>    

<p> "Tara, go find out why Kajabi has not come today" Tara's mother
said. "If she is not going to come I might as well do the dishes."</p>

<p> "I will go to her house right away" said Tara.</p>

<p> Tara  always loved  visiting Kajabi's house.  Kajabi was
their house  maid and she  lived in a slum  nearby. Kajabi's
house was  next to a sewage  drain and there was  a bad odor
about  the place all  the time.  Tara did  not mind  it. She
really  loved the  little huts  and it  reminded her  of her
native village. In Bombay only  the very poor or rich people
lived in  independent houses. The middle  class people lived
in huge ugly buildings.</p>

<p> Tara entered Kajabi's house and exclaimed "Your house is so
clean. Outside everything is so dirty but inside, your house is clean
like a temple. It is even cleaner than my house."</p>

<p> Kajabi smiled and said "That is not true Tara. Will you have some tea?"</p>

<p> "No, I do not want any tea. Mummy was asking why you did not come for
work today."</p>

<p> "My daughter is ill so I cannot come for work today. Tell your mother
I will definitely come tomorrow. Here take some jeera golis and red
mango slices."</p>

<p> Kajabi offered Tara some snacks from a bottle.</p>

<p> "Give it to me in a packet Kajabi. I will eat it slowly on the way
back" Tara said.</p>

<p> Kajabi wrapped two pieces of mango slices which were dipped in some red
color and dried and some jeera golis which were little tamarind balls
dipped in sugar and spice.</p>

<p> "I will tell mother that you will not come to work today" said
Tara. "Thanks for this yummy food."</p>

<p> With the little package in her hand Tara made her way back home
slowly. She stopped to watch people arranging the junk they had
collected. A lot of Kajabi's neighbors picked up paper, plastic
covers, rags, and other reusable trash from dust bins and they sold it
to shops and made a living that way. So Kajabi's neighborhood looked
like a little junk yard.  The little houses with such an open
lifestyle always intrigued Tara. She could see women cooking on
firewood unlike the gas stoves her mother used. They took so much care
about the one dish they prepared and they ground a lot of green
chillies. They washed their clothes slowly by the drain with little
water. They did everything outside their little homes and Tara looked
at everything with wonder as she walked back home.</p>

<p> "Kajabi cannot come today mother. Her daughter is ill but she will
come tomorrow" Tara told her mother.</p>

<p> "I might as well wash the dishes then. I will not wash the
clothes. Since she is coming tomorrow she can do it. Kajabi is a good
maid. She only takes leave if she really has a reason. What do you
have in your hand Tara?"</p>

<p> "Kajabi gave me some mango slices."</p>

<p> "How many times have I told you not to eat such things? Here give it
to me." </p>

<p> Her mother snatched the little package from her hand and threw it in
the dustbin.</p>

<p> "Mother why did you do that for? I always eat from the street vendor
at school and nothing ever happens to me. Kajabi's husband is also a
street vendor and I do not see how eating what he prepares will make
me sick when what the other vendors prepared did not make me sick." </p>

<p> "You should not eat from street vendors Tara. It is lucky that you did
not get sick. You just came from Kajabi's house didn't you? You saw
that they do not have drinking water. Whatever drinking water she has,
she has to carry from our house. They cannot keep clean Tara. You
should not eat such things." </p>

<p> "Nothing will happen to me. I have a strong immune system and I
want to make it stronger by eating the peddler's food." </p>

<p> "I will just stop giving you any pocket money if you continue eating
junk food." </p>

<p> Tara laughed and helped her mother with the dishes. </p>

<p> Junk food sold at school was a health concern for all the elders of
the city.  As soon as it was lunch break, or when the school was over
for the day, a little market would form outside the schools. The
vendors went from one school to the other at these times. Tara's
school had tried in so many ways to try and stop the children from
eating at these food stalls. They tried imposing fines on students and
sending complaints to parents. Sometimes the police would come and
chase these people away. But none of these measures were really
effective. The vendors sold a variety of food items. Tara loved eating
the ice cream cones which were rumored to contain paper pulp . Maybe
someone spread that story to discourage kids from eating the vendor's
ice creams. But it never deterred Tara from eating it every day. Also
she loved the kulfis. For Tara the street vendors were an integral
part of her school life. Moreover people like Kajabi's husband made a
living this way. </p>

<p> After a few days Kajabi turned up at Tara's house at an unusual hour
late in the evening.  Kajabi appeared agitated about something.
As soon as Kajabi met Tara's mother she began her story. </p>

<p> "You know what happened today. Some young boys surrounded my husband
and they took his box away. They also cut his beard with scissors." </p>

<p> "Really, did they cut your husband's beard off?" Tara asked incredulously. </p>

<p> Tara's mother had to laugh when she pictured Kajabi's husband without
his beard. Kajabi's husband was a religious old man with a white
flowing beard. He was a good husband compared to husbands of
housemaids in general. He never drank or hit Kajabi. Kajabi never had
any trouble from her husband except that they were really poor. </p>

<p> "My husband is not going to go to work for a few days till all these
rioting is over" Kajabi said shaking her head. "It is weird. They
were a bunch of young boys. Baiji, I will be needing two hundred
rupees in advance to buy my husband another box." </p>

<p> Kajabi left with the money Tara's mother gave her. The riots raged in
Bombay for many days after. But Tara's part of Bombay was
peaceful. There were no riots here. Though other parts of Bombay were
burning and people were getting killed, for Tara, it was like things
were happening really far away.  </p>

<p> But one night Tara had to wake up suddenly in the middle of the
night. She could hear shouting and roaring like she had never heard
before. She saw that her family was looking out of the windows
already. She saw a large group of people mostly young boys carrying
swords and sticks and rushing towards some place. They were destroying
property all over. </p>

<p> "Why are these people breaking all these gates and lamp posts?" asked
Tara.  "They are going somewhere else. I do not think they have
anything against these people living around us yet they are destroying
so much property. Why mother?" 

<p> "I do not know Tara. All these are mad people. They have nothing to
do. They have no jobs. They drink and fight all the time" Tara's
mother told her. </p>

<p> Tara could not forget the incident. She kept wondering why is that
when people are rioting they can destroy so much and get away with it
when in normal times they would be severely punished.</p>

<p> "I think rioting is like war" said Tara. "People like wars. Now two
countries can have a war. But within a country since it is no longer
possible to have wars they have devised this thing called riots. Why
is it so necessary for people to be fighting all the time?" </p>

<p> "Have you watched Ant colonies?" Tara's father asked. "They fight
and destroy. Do we try to understand that? No. All this is nature's
way. People are part of nature. There are a lot of things that we
cannot comprehend." </p>

<p> "I guess you are right. People believe that humans can reason. But
then we all reason about the same thing in so many different ways then
what is the use of the ability to reason? Reasoning would help only if
everyone could come to the same conclusion. Maybe like animals we also
only have instincts." </p>

<p> "Tara you will turn out to be a philosopher. I do not know. I
have stopped thinking about such things. There is a lot of things we
do not understand. It is a waste of time trying to reason why. Try to
think how can you avoid getting into trouble or how you can contribute
something positive to society. That will be a real good thing. There
are not many people who are even a bit sensible." </p>

<p> "But daddy, everyone I see around me seem sensible. You are
sensible. I could never imagine you running around the streets with a
rod in hand. I cannot imagine our neighbors doing that either. Who are
these people who do such things? Has nature created them for doing
such things?" </p>

<p> "You are getting ahead of me here. Maybe when you grow up you will be
able to provide more answers than I can at this point." </p>

<p> Soon Tara went back to bed but the horror of the night kept disturbing
her sleep. All the greed, power, and hatred involved in a riot was too
much for a young girl's mind. </p>
