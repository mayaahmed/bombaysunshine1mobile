<h3> Chapter 3 </h3>
<h2>Black Magic with Drumsticks</h2>
        
<p>"My mother has asked me to buy drumsticks and sugar on the way back
from school" Jaya said. "So I have to stop at a couple of shops
today."</p>

<p>"Let us split up the chores. I will get the drumsticks and you
get the sugar. That way we will be done faster" Tara suggested.</p>

<p>"Okay. That sounds good. Let us do that. You go and buy drumsticks
worth one rupee" said Jaya giving a rupee to Tara. </p>

<p>Jaya then went to the Baniya's store to get sugar. Baniya was the name
of a class of people who came from North of India and they operated
stores all over Bombay. A typical Baniya store sold grains, sugar, and
other stationery. Even if the shop did not belong to a Baniya, a shop
of this type was called Baniya store.</p>

<p>Tara, on the other hand, went to a nearby vegetable shop. It was a
small shed made of jute clothes and the vegetables were placed on
wooden tables. A few such shops clustered together made up a market.</p>

<p>"Give me drum sticks worth one rupee" Tara told the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>The shop keeper gave her 4 drum sticks. Now Tara was not sure that
this was the right amount for one rupee. There was no preordained
pricing listed. It was only by experience that one knew how much
one should expect for one rupee. Tara was a little concerned since
she was buying the drum sticks for her friend. Then she remembered
that one had to bargain at vegetable shops.</p>

<p>"That is too less, give me some more" Tara said.</p>

<p>"You think it is less?" the shopkeeper asked.</p>

<p>"Yes" said Tara a little uncertain about the real price.</p>

<p>Now the Shopkeeper was in a naughty mood. He was surrounded by a group
of friends. He turned around and smiled and said 

<p>"Okay, if this is less, take this." </p>

<p>He took all the drumsticks in the basket and handed it to Tara and he
laughed. Tara was a bit shocked. It was quite clear that this was way
too much drumsticks for one rupee. But she did not know what to
do. She was quite embarrassed and she took the drumsticks from the
shopkeeper.</p>

<p>The shopkeeper and his friends laughed at her embarrassment. The
shopkeeper asked "Is that quite enough?"</p>

<p>Tara straightened up and said with a grim face </p>

<p>"Yes, that is quite enough, Thank you." </p> 

<p> She paid him the rupee and left with whatever dignity she could muster
up. </p>

<p> "I asked you to  get drumsticks worth one rupee. It looks like
you bought drumsticks worth ten rupees" Jaya exclaimed. </p>

<p> "That man gave me these many drumsticks for one rupee" Tara said. </p>

<p> "What did you do?" Jaya asked. </p>

<p> "I bargained" Tara said feeling a little sheepish.</p>

<p> "You bargained? You silly moron" Jaya said smiling. "Now what do we do
with these extra drumsticks. I surely cannot take this to my house. My
mother will think I winked at the shopkeeper."  </p>

<p> "Let us just throw away the extra drumsticks" Tara suggested. </p>

<p> "No, we cannot waste food. Don't you know that so many poor people
die of hunger in India everywhere?" Jaya scolded. </p>

<p> "But drumsticks are just for flavoring. It cannot be a meal for
anyone. It is okay to throw it away."  </p>

<p> "The key word here is food. You should not throw food. Do you
realize how hard the farmers work in the field to grow food.
They plow using Bullocks. Those animals also work hard. You must
not waste food ever." </p> 

<p> "Okay, Okay. I got the drift. I will not waste food ever."  </p>

<p> "Why don't you take this to your house?"  </p>

<p> "I cannot do that. I will have to do some explaining to my mother.
Let me think what we can do."  </p>

<p> It was a dilemma. They walked a little ahead and they saw some more
vegetable sellers.  These were different from the shopkeepers who had
sheds. These sellers sat on the streets and placed the vegetables to
sell on a jute cloth on the ground. They were poorer than the jute
shed shopkeepers.  This gave Tara an idea. </p>

<p> "Let us give these drumsticks to that old lady who is selling
vegetables" said Tara.  </p>

<p> Tara went over to the old lady and offered the drumsticks to her. </p>

<p> "Here, Maji. I have some extra drum sticks. you can have it." </p>

<p> The old lady was a bit shocked. She was the one who was selling
vegetables and she had been selling vegetables for ages now.  It was
she who offered a few coriander leaves or a piece of ginger or a
little curry leaves for free if she felt like to people who bought
vegetables from her. Now out of the blue came two silly girls
offering free drumsticks to her. </p>

<p> "What do you take me for? Am I beggar? Mala nakko. Mala nakko" the old
lady said angrily. </p>

<p>  Mala nakko meant I do not want in Marathi and the old lady made sure
the two girls got that straight and clear. </p>

<p> "Sorry maji'' Tara said sincerely. "I did not mean to hurt your
pride. I am sorry if I angered you." </p>

<p> "That is okay. Now go away you silly girls. I have work to do"
the old lady said. </p>

<p> "Boy! Why did she have to get so angry for? What a grouch?!" Jaya
exclaimed. </p>

<p> "You know Jaya. I think I understand. There is very little difference
in her life style and a beggar's lifestyle. If she is able to work
hard at this age and not turn into a beggar, it is because of her
pride. Her pride gives her the strength to sit on the road each day
and sell vegetables and carry her load around" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "I guess you are right Tara. But now we still have the problem
of these extra drumsticks."  </p>

<p> And when they reached their building they still had not got rid
of the drumsticks. </p>

<p> "Now we are almost home. What do we do with these drumsticks?"
Jaya asked. </p>


<p> "I have an idea" Tara said suddenly. "Let us put these drumsticks
in Seema Akka's bag." </p>

<p> Seema Akka had a bag hanging outside her door. She left it there
for the milk man. Every morning he would place packets of milk in
those bags. The milk man usually came real early in the morning and
this way she did not have to wake up. </p>

<p> "Why don't we just give it to her?" Jaya asked. </p>

<p> "We will have to explain where we got these drumsticks from.
If we just put it in the bag we are better off."  </p>

<p> "I think that is a good idea" Jaya said. "You go and put the drumsticks
in the bag and I will keep a watch here." </p>

<p> So while Jaya kept a watch Tara went and put the drumsticks in Seema
Akka's bag. And the two of them ran upstairs giggling their heads off. </p>

<p> Now Seema Akka had a habit of doing black magic with lemons and chillies.
She tied these things in a string and if she hated somebody she would
utter a lot of curses and put these lemons secretly outside their doors.
Using lemons and chillies to ward off evil was a common practice in
Bombay. So if someone saw a lemon tied with a string to a few chillies
no one picked it up. But when Seema Akka saw these drum sticks 
she was a little surprised. She never imagined that anyone could do
black magic with drumsticks. </p>

<p> But Seema Akka was not a person to take chances. She called a priest
and did a major religious ceremony to ward off any evil that might
have affected her house. When Tara saw all the activity in Seema
Akka's house she was surprised. Later in the evening Jaya came over to
Tara's house for a chat. </p>

<p> "Maybe we should have just thrown the drumsticks away. We seemed to have
given Seema Akka a shock" Tara said. </p>

<p> "Not all is wasted. At least we had a good laugh" said Jaya and  Tara had to 
agree. </p>
