<h3> Chapter 4 </h3>
<h2>A friend in love </h2>
       

<p>Tara's friend Padma had news that she was in love. The news amused
Tara. Though the movies and books were always full of love stories, to
really get involved in one was not that savvy. To a teenage girl it
clearly spelled trouble.</p>

<p>Tara recited solemnly: </p>

<p>
"So I turned to the garden of love,
<br/>
that so many sweet flowers bore,
<br/>
And I saw it was filled with graves."  </p>

<p>"Cynic" Padma scolded.</p>

<p>Tara laughed and said </p> 

<p> "That verse is by William Blake. He is the cynic not me. Do we
grudge a pretty rose its existence just because it is ephemeral?
No. Beautiful things are always good for the soul." </p>

<p> "What is ephemeral?" Padma asked. </p>

<p> "Ephemeral means short lived.  Love is known to be short lived."  </p>

<p> "I will prove otherwise. I will bet that my romance will endure
the test of time."  </p>

<p> "There is no empirical evidence to support your claim. But this is one
bet I will be glad to lose Padma. You look so happy. Love has
made you prettier than before."  </p>

<p> Sure enough there was a glow on Padma's face. Tara was a little
concerned about Padma. Her parents were very orthodox and Tara
did not know how they would react if they knew that Padma was
bunking classes and meeting Manoj. Manoj lived in an apartment
opposite to Padma's apartment. </p>

<p> "I am not afraid. I do not care for anything except Manoj" Padma
said as though in a dream.  </p>

 <p>  Just then Manoj surfaced on the Veranda opposite and Tara left the
couple to their new found happiness. </p>

<p>  And then one day the inevitable happened. Padma and Manoj belonged to
two different communities. These communities were constantly at war
and the hate percolated surprisingly even to teenagers. So a group of
girls in Padma's class decided to break this little secret to Padma's
mother. </p>

<p> And that evening when Padma got back supposedly from college but
really from a movie she went with Manoj to, she met with a real angry
mother at the door. That was the last anyone saw of Padma. She was
locked up in a room and the family did not open the door to anyone. In
the morning the father left for work and in the evening the mother
would open the door only after hearing his voice. The front door
opened to no one. Not to vendors, Not to friends. </p>

<p> Now the curiosity of the building people was intense about this affair.
The eyes were glued to that door in intense expectation. People were
constantly guessing about what is going on and what is going to happen.  </p>

<p> Poor Manoj. He was hardly seventeen years of age. He had
no job and there was nothing he could do. He hung around and
tried to knock at the front door but everyone knew including
him  that he  could do  nothing. One  day when  everyone was
watching a really favorite TV program Padma was shipped away
to  her native  village.  When  Tara heard  of  it she  felt
sad. </p>

<p> "Girls are so much trouble for her parents" said Tara's mother.
"See how much sorrow she brought to herself and her family."  </p>

<p>  "Yes" said Tara. "Manoj's family did not do anything. Manoj was not
locked up or shipped to a village. But he was involved as much as
Padma in the whole thing."  </p>


<p> That night Tara wrote in her diary:  </p>

<p> "Padma, you won the bet. Your romance is now a pathological one.  The
world loves pathological romances. I will surely remember your story
now. One goes after happiness but it is sorrow that triumphs. It is
misery that leaves a mark and arouses deep interest compared to mild
happiness."  </p>

<p> Days went  by and there was no news  of Padma. Now Seema
Akka had  the habit of hanging  her washed saris  to dry all
over the common veranda. The  long saris blocked the view of
people who  lived in the  floor below. It was  very annoying
and any amount  of complaining did not stop  Seema Akka from
hanging her  saris to dry  thus. One day Padma's  mother got
angry and  she tied knots  on the hanging saris.  When Seema
Akka saw this she got very angry. </p>

<p> "Who tied  knots in my saris?" she shouted.  </p>

<p> No one answered. </p> 

<p> "Who is the witch who tied knots in my saris?" she growled. </p>

<p> Now Padma's mother did not like someone calling her a witch so
she came out and said "I tied the knots." </p>

<p> "Now may I ask what prompted you to do that?" Seema Akka asked. </p>

<p> "My view was blocked."   </p>

<p> "Oh ho! So your view was blocked was it? But the movie is over isn't it?
What else is left to watch?" Seema Akka asked sarcastically. </p>

<p> Padma's mother was shocked. She knew that Seema Akka was pointing to
the affair of her daughter. Her eyes clouded with tears and she went
inside her house without a further word. Tara was hanging around with
her friends and she saw the whole thing.  She did not like what she
saw and she decided to act. </p>

<p> "What was this movie you were talking about Seema Akka?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "Don't you know about the movie that was going on in that house?" Seema
Akka asked rolling her eyeballs. </p>

<p> "No, I do not know anything about it. I must have missed something
exciting."  </p>

<p> Tara then turned to her friend and asked "Do you know anything about
the movie Jaya?"   </p>

<p> "No, nothing at all" Jaya said catching the drift of Tara's plan. </p>

<p> "Do you know anything Seeta?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "No, I do not know anything about it either" Seeta said smiling. </p>

<p> Now Seema Akka was a little confused. She thought that this was
public knowledge and how come Padma's close friends did not know
anything. Was her information wrong? </p>

<p> "I heard that Padma and Manoj had something going on ..." Seema Akka
started to say a little confused. </p>

<p>That was the wrong thing to say. There were other ladies around and
they did not like what they heard Seema  Akka say. Somethings were
all understood but never mentioned especially in front of young
girls. </p>

<p>"Watch what you are saying you moron" an old lady who overheard the
conversation warned. "Just because you have no daughters does not give
you a right to malign the names of other people's daughters." </p>

<p> Now Charu who lived in the same floor as Padma and who had been
suffering the habit of Seema Akka's hanging saris  took this
opportunity to speak her mind. </p>

<p> "Padma's mother was right in tying knots on your saris Seema Akka. You
hang your saris and make other people suffer. Did you live in a jungle
before you came to live here?" </p>

<p>"Where will I hang my saris? On your head?" Seema  Akka asked angrily. </p>

<p> "Instead of talking like a mad woman why don't you use your head and
figure out where you can hang your saris?" Charu replied. "Or you
could always fold your saris so that it does not hang so low and block
people's view." </p>

<p>Seema Akka heard nothing but that she was called a mad woman.  She got
very angry and shouted: "Who are you calling mad woman?  No respect
for my Grey hair. You are the mad woman here. Mad woman. Mad woman.
Mad woman." </p>

<p> At this point Charu shook her head and said "There is no point
talking to you."   </p>

<p>Charu went inside her house and slammed the door. Seema Akka was
fuming with rage. She kept complaining about how she was called a mad
woman but she had no audience left. Everyone went inside their house. 
After some time, Tara decided to visit Padma's mother. As she descended
the stairs a lot of questions formed in her head.  </p>

<p>What was  this society  that Padma's mother,  her mother,
and everyone  else she knew was  in so much in  awe for? Did
the people of her building define society? Or did the people
of Bombay  define society? Society  was like the  concept of
god. Everyone  had their own definition.  They defined their
own  fears of society.  They also  defined their  own rules.
Society like  religion was  very personal. Nowhere  was this
more evident than in that little square building of Bombay. </p>

<p> Padma's mother was sitting at a desk with her head on the table. She was
crying quietly. She looked up and saw Tara. Tara did not want to judge.
She just gave Padma's mother a hug. </p>
