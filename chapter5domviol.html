<h3> Chapter 5 </h3>
<h2>Domestic Violence </h2>

<p>Jaya's sister  was getting  married and Jaya  was talking
about the wedding all the time. Tara missed Manda very badly
and decided  to drop  in at  her home on  her way  back from
college. The front door  was closed. Tara heard some voices.
She knew Manda  usually left the back door  open. So wanting
to surprise Manda she entered through the back door. </p>

<p> Tara was shocked when she entered the house. Ajit was kicking Manda on
the face with boots. Manda's face was bleeding. Manda's eight month's
old baby was on her lap.  Manda was protecting the child from Ajit's
kicks. </p>

<p>They did not see Tara enter the room. May be if Tara was not so young
she would have behaved differently.  After wards Tara had wondered
whether her mother would have behaved similarly. At that moment all
that Tara could think was Ajit the enemy was hurting her sister. Tara
took the first handy thing she found, a chair, and directed a full
blow at Ajit which sent him reeling on the floor. </p>

<p>"Tara, stop. Don't. Don't" Manda screamed as Tara was going to hit
Ajit again. </p>

<p> But Tara stayed poised thus for she thought that Ajit might attack
 her. After all she had hit him real hard. But to her surprise Ajit
 looked embarrassed. He got up slowly with a sheepish smile as though
 everything was a joke. And he stood there with the same stupid smile. </p>

<p>Tara realized that there was no physical danger from Ajit to her.
Ajit, to Tara's reasoning, was the kind of man who could only hit
somebody who would not hurt him back. Then Tara saw that Manda's face
was bleeding badly.  Tara went immediately to the fridge and got some
ice cubes and started dressing Manda's wounds. This act of Tara broke
Manda down completely. Manda started crying.  Manda had accepted blows
from her husband and harsh words from him as a part of being
married. Manda never complained and she had gotten used to her life
the way it was. But Tara's act of concern reminded her of the past
when people were sensitive to her every whim and fancy. Manda realized
that the life she lived now shocked the people who loved her. Manda
wanted to say a lot of things but words failed her and she simply
cried. </p>

<p>Ajit tried to come close to Manda. The baby was also crying. Tara went
to the phone and called her mother. Right from the earlier days it was
quite clear that Ajit was not exactly an ideal husband to Manda. He
was short tempered and complained a lot about Manda. But Tara's
parents had chosen to keep mum. Tara would defend her sister and yell
at Ajit but it was all taken lightly.  But now matters were serious
because there was physical violence. Tara's parents were in a position
from which they could not get out without doing something.</p>

<p>Tara realized that Manda had wanted to avoid putting her parents in
that spot. Manda was ready to suffer in silence. And it wasn't as
though Ajit was consistently bad. He was more like Jekyl and Hyde. He
had two personalities. He was very loving at times and vicious at
other times.  Manda's parents came over and they decided to take Manda
with them.  Ajit wasn't ready to send Manda over and he was in
tears. He said he was sorry and he did not know what came over
him. Tara was surprised to see that Manda after a few hours of crying
was quite willing to forgive and forget. And late at night Tara and
her parents went back home without Manda.</p>

<p>But Tara could never forget what she had seen that evening. A lot of
questions remained unanswered for her. She wondered whether Ajit hit
her often. She looked for signs of violence every time Manda visited
them. Tara reasoned that if Ajit really loved Manda as the others
in her family were claiming then there could be no torture. Being
loving at times was easy. Being kind consistently was the only relation
based on mutual respect. Why did Manda not reason thus? Was Manda blindly
in love with Ajit that it affected her reasoning? Or was it that any kind
of relationship with a man was better than none? It was quite certain
that it would have been difficult for Manda to get married again. That
would mean no more relationship with a man because her society banned
any relationship outside marriage. Or was it that Manda was afraid of
society? Divorced women were not well received in society. Or was it that
Manda was really happy married to Ajit? That was the most mind boggling
question to Tara. Because all signs lead to this question.</p>

<p>Manda as always never had any complaints. She looked like a happily
married woman every time Tara saw her.</p>

<p>"I am never going to be married" Tara declared to Jaya.</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass Tara" said Jaya. "Ajit obviously does not love your
sister.  That is why he hits her. Not all husbands do things like
that.  I am sure your husband is going to be henpecked." </p>

<p>Tara sighed and wondered what her husband would be like.</p>
