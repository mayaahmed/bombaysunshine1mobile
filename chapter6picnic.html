<h3> Chapter 6 </h3>
<h2>The Class picnic</h2>



<p> "Mummy, our class is going to Matheran for the annual picnic" Tara
told her mother. "It will be for three days. I want to go for it." </p>

<p> "I don't think your dad will allow you to go" Tara's mother said
quietly.</p>


<p> "But I want to go to this camp. It is in Matheran. All my friends are
going. My whole class is going. Why can't I go?"</p>

<p> "Don't argue Tara. You cannot go. That is all. All these overnight
camps are not safe for girls. The newspapers are full of horrible
stories. Moreover your father will not let you go. So forget about
this camp. Go and study."</p>

<p> "Please, please, please" Tara pleaded.</p>

<p> "Keep quiet. Do not eat my head. I have work to do." </p>

<p> Tara's mother declared an end to the conversation and went in to the
kitchen. There was not much Tara could do with her mother so she
concentrated on convincing her father when he got back from office.</p>

<p> "Daddy, can I go to the school picnic to Matheran?" Tara asked.</p>

<p> "No" her father said.</p>

<p> "All my friends are going, papa. Can I please please go?" Tara pleaded.</p>

<p> "Ask your mother."</p>

<p> "But mummy said to ask you. Please can I go."</p>

<p> "I do not know. Ask your mother." </p>

<p> Tara realized this conversation was going no where. She sat in a
corner and sulked. Her father looked up from his newspaper once in a
while to see how Tara was reacting. Tara knew this. So she sulked all
the more. Her father hated to see her sulk. </p>

<p> "You know I care for you. If something happened to you what will I
do?" her father asked. </p>

<p> "What can happen?" Tara asked.  "It is a school picnic. I am not
going to some Jungle." </p>

<p> Tara knew that her father was paranoid. Her father was convinced
something terrible would happen to her if she ever went to an
overnight picnic. Also recently there were some stories in the
newspapers about some young girls getting in to trouble at some school
picnic. So her father's protective instincts were working
overtime. What else could Tara do? She sat and sulked the rest of the
evening but no permission was  coming her way. </p>

<p> When she got to school the next day, Tara said </p>
 
<p> "My parents will not allow me to go to Matheran."  </p>

<p> "It will not be fun without you, Tara" Jaya said. "Please come." </p>

<p> "You nutcase. Don't you realize that I want to come? It is my parents who
are not allowing me to go."  </p>

<p> Tara was a little angry and  sad. </p>

<p> "Why is it my parents are so paranoid about me? What did I do, Jaya?
Your parents trust you and let you go everywhere. Now why is my
parents not like that?" </p>

<p> "Maybe I look more sensible than you do" Jaya said. </p>

<p> "Bah! I do not think so. It is just that some parents are just like that." </p>

<p> "See, you answered your question yourself. Why ask me when you already
know the answers?" </p>

<p> "Do not hassle me when I am already bugged" Tara said grumpily. </p>
 
<p> All her friends sat quietly  sharing the angry mood. </p>

<p> "What if I come and ask your parents?" Jaya asked suddenly. </p>

<p> "That is a good idea" Tara exclaimed. </p>

<p> "I will also come and ask your parents" Seeta said. </p>

<p> "Me too" added Mala. </p>

<p> "Let us all go" Jaya said. "That is the whole class should go
to Tara's house and ask her parents to let her come with us to
Matheran." </p>

<p> Everyone agreed. They started planning the details. </p>

<p> "My father is not going to work on Thursday" Tara said. "We can all
go to my house at lunch break." </p>

<p> Tara's parents were shocked to see the whole class in their house
Thursday afternoon. All the girls started saying at once: </p>

<p> "Uncle, please send Tara. Aunty, please send Tara."  </p>

<p> Tara's parents exchanged glances. Tara's mother smiled and shrugged. </p>

<p> "Okay, okay, okay" Tara's father laughed and said.  He was a bit
overwhelmed with Tara's popularity. </p>

<p> Everyone shouted with joy. </p>

<p> "Three cheers for uncle and aunty" Jaya shouted. "Hip, hip..."  </p> 

<p> "Hurray" shouted all. </p>

<p> Tara's mother got drinks and goodies for all and every one went back
to school happy with the strategy. </p>

<p> "That is strange" Tara said.  "It must be mass psyche or
something. The concerns my dad had about me should not go away just
because all of you came and asked him to let me go to the picnic. Why
did he agree?" </p>

<p> "There is strength in numbers, surely" Jaya said. "I think he
probably did not want to disappoint a whole class."</p>

<p> "May be we can use this strategy for Nanda's parents too" Tara said
happily. "Also for Lalita and Meena. So this year all of us in the
class can go to Matheran. It is going to be fun."</p>

<p> Sure enough this strategy worked very well and that year all the girls
in Tara's class managed to get permission to go to the picnic to
Matheran.</p>

<p>  Finally it was picnic day. Tara was very excited. She had to be in
  school at five in the morning. She was happy to see all her friends
  gathered there. Tara could hardly talk because of all her
  excitement. They sat in the school bus and sang </p>

<p> "B ,O, M, B, A, Y, Bombay. 
<br/>
We are the girls, we are the boys.
<br/>
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bombay." </p>

<p> They sang a lot of other songs and quite loudly too. A school picnic bus
could always be heard way down the road. </p>

<p>  "Do you want some potato chips?" Jaya asked. </p>

<p>  "Hey I have got potato chips too" Tara said. "It looks like potato
chips is picnic food."  </p>

<p>This brought forth giggles from all around. </p>

<p>  "You girls are always giggling for nothing, silly girls" a teacher
scolded. </p>

<p> After the bus ride, they had to sit in a small train to reach
Matheran. When the train stopped in one station, a little girl came
running to Tara's window and asked "Baiji, Baiji do you want nice cold
water?".

<p> The little girl had a mud pot in her hand and the water looked
inviting. Tara was not particularly thirsty but she drank the water
anyways. </p>

<p>  "Give me ten paisa for it" the girl said. </p>

<p>  "Are you selling water?" Tara asked surprised. </p>

<p>  "How can you sell water?" Mala exclaimed. "That is against religion." </p>

<p>  "But I need money to eat."  </p>

<p> Tara decided  to give  the little girl ten paisa.  </p>

<p>  "What is the world coming to?" asked Mala shaking her head.  "They
 are selling water."  </p>
 
<p> "The world is already not such a great place when a little girl has
 to run around selling water to earn a living" Tara said quietly.  </p>

<p>  "Yes and on top of that hear sarcastic comments from people like
 you" Jaya scolded Mala. Mala just made a face in reply.  </p>

<p>  The train continued to Matheran slowly. At Matheran the students
  stayed in a motel which was actually a large house with lots of
  rooms. The landlady came out to greet everyone.  For dinner they
  were served pooris, sheera, pulao, and other goodies. Somehow after
  the journey the food tasted very good.  </p>

<p>  There was something nice and different about being so far away from
home. It was like being really grown up. They did not wear school
uniforms but regular clothes. Everyone took extra care to look
nice. Everyone wore make up which was not generally allowed until
one was married. But during school picnics all rules were relaxed. </p>

<p>    A small group of good friends shared a room with Tara. </p>

<p>    "I will tell you a ghost story" said Raji when the girls were all
   comfortable in bed. </p>

<p>    "Your stories are all the same" said Tara.  "The female ghosts
   are always dressed in a white sari and look beautiful. Then
   suddenly they look ghastly, drink blood, and kill. I am not scared
   of your stories." </p>

<p>     "This story will scare you for real" said Raji. </p>

<p>  She then went ahead and told a real scary story. At the end of the
story all the girls were really quiet. They were too scared to say
anything. Even Raji had scared herself with her own story. In Matheran
ghosts may really exist and perhaps it was not a good idea to tempt
ghosts with stories about them. The best thing to do now was to go to
sleep. So Tara quickly covered her face with a blanket and tried to
sleep. </p>


<p>  Tara woke up early the next day and decided to go for a walk. Matheran
was a little hill station on the outskirts of Bombay. It was a very
popular place to visit since it was very cool in summers and it was so
close to Bombay. But it was very different from crowded Bombay. The
motel was surrounded by trees and there were no houses nearby. Tara
could see trees as far as her eyes could see. Tall eucalyptus trees
which emitted a pleasant smell. The gardens were filled with Jasmine
plants which bloomed in the evening and had a heady fragrance. </p>

<p> Suddenly, among the bushes, Tara saw a little puppy running around. It
looked so cute that Tara decided to pick it up. She picked up the
puppy and played with its fur. Then Tara saw a girl standing in front
of her. There was something strange about the girl's movements.
Looking at her closely Tara saw that this girl was what people called
spastic or mentally retarded.  </p>

<p> "Give me the the the puppy" the girl said stammering a little. </p>

<p> Tara handed the puppy to the girl and asked </p>

<p> "Is that your puppy?" </p>

<p> "Yes."  </p>

<p> "What is its name?" </p>

<p> "Chikku." </p>

<p> "Chikku? Can I play with it a little more?" </p>

<p> "Okay, take" the girl said and handed the puppy to Tara.</p>

<p> Then Tara and the girl went and sat under a tree.</p>

<p> "Do you take care of the puppy?" Tara asked.</p>

<p> "Yes" the girl answered beaming with joy.</p>

<p> "Is it a lot of work?" </p>

<p> "Yes." </p>

<p> The girl then described to Tara what her dog ate, how he tore
newspapers, liked to pull at her skirt, and many other things about
her dog. Tara found the girl's style of conversation very
interesting. It was a detailed description of everyday events using
very few words. Tara was intrigued by this pattern of speech which
expressed so much with so little resources in terms of vocabulary.</p>

<p> The landlady came out and saw the two girls sitting and chatting
thus. She was surprised. The girl was the landlady's daughter. </p>

<p> "Is Sujata talking to you?" the landlady asked.  "This is a
surprise. Sujata is usually very shy." </p>

<p> "I guess we got along quite well" Tara said. </p>

<p> "Say good bye  to Tara, Sujata. It is time for your breakfast."</p>

<p> "Good bye" said Sujata and she left with the landlady.</p>

<p> The next day Tara was sitting on a swing with her friends. The girls
were taking turns at singing songs. Tara looked around lazily and saw
Sujata standing underneath a tree and watching her.</p>

<p> "Hi Sujata" Tara said. "Come here." </p>

<p> "No, you come here" Sujata said. </p>

<p> "Okay."  </p>

<p> Tara went to where Sujata was standing.  </p>

<p> "Here, you can play with my puppy" Sujata said with a smile.  </p>

<p> "Can my friends play with him too?" Tara asked.  </p>

<p> "Okay" Sujata said a little hesitantly.  </p>

<p>  Tara introduced Sujata to her friends.  </p>

<p> "Sujata, can you sing a song?" Jaya asked.  </p>

<p> Sujata was a little shy and did not reply. </p>

<p> "I know you can sing a song" Tara said. </p>

<p> "Will you sing a song for us?" Seeta  asked. </p>

<p> "Okay" said Sujata and she sang  </p>

<p> "Ek batte do, do batte chaar,

<br/>
choti choti baton mein bat gaya sansar.
<br/>
Nahi batega Nahi bata hai
<br/>
Mummy daddy ka pyaar (which meant the only thing constant is a
parent's love)".
</p>

<p> When the landlady came and saw this scene she was very touched.</p>

<p> "Come along Sujata we must go now" she said. </p>

<p> "Can I stay a little longer?" Sujata asked. </p>

<p> "No, it is time for your lunch." </p>

<p> After sometime the landlady came to talk to Tara and her friends. </p>

<p> "Thank you for being nice to my daughter. I did not know that she
could sing. She must have been quite comfortable with you people to do
that."</p>


<p> She told them about how Sujata became retarded, how she had been a
normal child for a while, and how her life span was short. She would
die soon.  </p>

<p> "It is better that she dies young, because after me I do not know who
will take care of her." </p> 

<p> "Tomorrow is another day" Tara said.  "Why mess up today worrying
about tomorrow?" </p>

<p> This statement was so much out of context with the sombre mood set up
by the landlady that at first people did not know how to react. Tara
sensed that she must have goofed by how her friends reacted. Looking
at Tara's face Jaya started to laugh. Then everyone laughed looking a
little carefully at the landlady so as to not offend her. Finally the
good cheer caught up and the landlady smiled too and said </p>

<p> "Tara, you are right. Tomorrow is another day.  You girls have a nice
day." </p>

<p> "Sure we will" they said all at once. </p>

<p> They really did have a nice day. They trekked all around the hills of
Matheran that day. It was nice to walk among the tall trees and listen
to the rustle of leaves and chirping of birds. There was no sound of
traffic or cries of vendors. It was so different from crowded Bombay.</p>

<p> "It is so quiet and peaceful here" Tara said.</p>

<p> "Yes, I do not know how anyone can live here" Jaya said. "This place
is okay to visit but one cannot live here."</p>

<p> "Yes, if one had to live here we will have to rethink our lifestyles
from scratch" sighed Tara.  "Too much trouble."</p>

<p> And then for some reason Mala began talking about Prema. Prema was a
senior who was very dominating. She was always giving advice whether
someone wanted to listen or not. That morning Prema had made Mala angry
and while talking about the incident Mala began shouting </p>

<p> "Prema is a donkey. She is an ass. She is a moron."  </p>

<p>  At this point of the conversation a girl walked by and somehow she
 thought that Mala was talking about her.  Perhaps her name was
 Prema. She was quite annoyed wondering why a group of strangers was
 calling her names. The girl decided to let go and walked a little
 ahead but her anger made her stop.  Mala continued her shouting: </p>

<p> "She is a eunuch. She really is a eunuch." </p>

<p> This was just a little too much for the girl. She retraced her
steps. The group had their backs turned to the girl except Tara. Tara
had stopped to admire a wild flower. When Tara looked up she saw an
angry girl threatening to hit her with a slipper in her hand. There
were no words. The girl did something that looked like an anger dance
and she hit the air angrily with her slippers. </p>

<p> Mala continued to shout "She is a eunuch. She is a donkey." </p> 

<p> Tara realized the misunderstanding and she began to laugh. Finally,
the entire group saw the girl performing her anger dance with a
slipper. At some point the girl decided she was outnumbered. She wore
her slipper and ran away. </p>

<p> "Mala, that girl thought that you were calling her names" Tara
explained. "She was so angry that she threatened to hit us with a
slipper." </p>

<p> Everyone laughed a lot when they understood what the slipper dance
meant. And soon it was time to return home. The girls packed up and
waited for the bus to go back to Bombay. </p>

<p> "I am here" Tara said. "Soon it will be I was here." </p>

<p> "These were fun days" Jaya said. </p>

<p> At a little distance Tara saw Sujata standing with her puppy. Tara
went to her and said </p>

<p> "Good bye Sujata. It was nice being here. Will you visit us in Bombay?" </p>

<p> "Yes" Sujata said a little sadly. "Here I have a present for you." </p>

<p> She gave Tara a picture of her and the puppy.  Tara was touched. </p>

<p> "Thank you" Tara said. </p>

<p> Tara noticed tears in Sujata's eyes. Tara was a little surprised at
the tears. Then she realized that Sujata was lonely and it was special
for her that she found a friend. For Tara things were different. Her
world was crowded with friends. Tara searched her bag to give
something in return. She found a little teddy bear. She gave that
to Sujata and Sujata smiled her little spastic smile. </p>

<p> "Friends forever?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "Yes" smiled Sujata. </p>

<p> When the bus left the place Tara and her friends waived good bye to
Sujata. As Tara left the place she felt guilty. She felt that she was
leaving Sujata friendless again and was abandoning her. The next
minute she laughed at her self importance. She wrote in her diary as
the bus continued towards Bombay: </p>

<p> "Why do I feel all that important? What do I count? Sujata's life
itself was destined to be short. Why should I regret this short
friendship that enriched mine and her life in some way or the other?
Maybe I do not count, maybe she did not count. But I promise I will
never forget her." </p>
