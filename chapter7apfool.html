<h3> Chapter 7 </h3>
<h2>Opening a Pandora's box</h2>

<p> Raji decided to open a Pandora's box. She liked a boy called Mandar for
about six months now and she wanted to tell him that. But Raji wanted
to say it with poetry. And she read it out loud for everyone's approval. </p>

<p> "I want to drink in your gentle face with my eyes." </p>

<p> "How can you drink with your eyes?" Mala scolded. "You cannot drink
a face. You can eat it if you want." </p> 

<p>  Mala had no patience for talk that was not logical. </p>

<p> "What I mean by that is that I like to look at a face."  </p>

<p> "Why can't you just say that? What is all these twisted nonsensical
 sentences? Mandar will reject you thinking you are brain dead." </p>

<p> "I want to say it poetically, you see." </p>

<p> "Continue" said Tara.   </p>

<p> Raji continued:  </p>

<p> "Okay. I want to drink in your gentle face with my eyes. I want to
arrest the gentle expression of your eyes in my heart forever."  </p>

<p> Mala laughed out aloud and said: </p>


<p> "Boy! This is too much. I guess Mandar must have committed some sin in
his last life and now he has to pay for it by listening to this crap.
I did not sin in my last life so you better save this for Mandar. Anyway
this is entertaining. I can promise myself a good laugh." </p>


<p> "I think your poem is good" said Tara hiding a smile.  "I
am sure Mandar will be flattered." </p>


<p> They decided that the best way to convey this to Mandar was by phone.
Mala dialed Mandar's phone number. When Mandar picked up the phone, she
quickly handed it over to Raji. </p>


<p> "Here, here, Mandar is on the line" said Mala. </p>


<p> Raji tried to read from the paper she had in her hand. But she was not
able to read correctly.  She rambled instead: </p>


<p> "I, you, you, I, want, eat, face, drink, I, water, ..." </p>

<p> Now the phone lines were bad. So Mandar had a tough time figuring out
what was going on. </p>

<p> "What water?" asked Mandar. "What water? What? Who?" </p>

<p> "I, you, drink, water, eat face, gentle face, eat, ..."  </p>

<p> "What? What? What? Who? Water? What? What?" </p>

<p> Soon all that Mandar could hear was a lot of laughter. </p>

<p> "What is going on? Who is this?" he asked in vain. </p>

<p> Raji decided to hang up at that point and said </p>

<p> "It is no use. I cannot read this poem on the phone." </p>

<p> "Good for you" said Mala. "It is better this way. If you had read
this poem you would have messed up your chances with Mandar." </p>

<p> Everyone was laughing their heads off and Raji laughed a little too.</p>

<p> After a few days it was the first of April. The girls came up with a
plan to fool Raji. </p>

<p> "Let us make a fool of Raji" said Mala.  "Let us call Raji and make
it sound like it is Mandar." </p> 

<p> "But our voices will be a problem" Tara said. </p>

<p> "Let us disguise it as best as possible. Let us give it a shot
anyways. It will generate some mirth." </p>

<p> The girls then called up Raji on the phone. </p>

<p> "Hello" said Raji on the phone. </p>

<p> Tara disguised her voice as best as she could while speaking. Also
since the girls had not decided on a script Tara had to say the first
thing that came to her mind. </p>

<p> "Hi Raji" said Tara. "This is your friend. How are you? Raji, do
you like baji (which meant curry)?" </p>

<p> Tara had a difficult time suppressing her laughter while talking. </p>

<p> "What do you mean?" Raji asked. </p>

<p> "Raji, you should eat baji. Baji is good for you Raji." </p>

<p> Tara could say no more. Laughter took over.  Tara kept the phone down
laughing. </p>

<p> "No way is Raji going to think that this was Mandar" said Tara. "But
it will be fun to hear what Raji has to say." </p>

<p> Tara and her friends waited for Raji to come and tell them about this
call.  And sure enough Raji surfaced soon.</p>

<p> "Today Mandar called me" Raji said.</p>

<p> Tara and her friends looked at each other. They could not keep a
serious face and they were laughing openly. </p>

<p> "He changed his voice and it sounded like a female's voice. But I
could tell it was him." </p>

<p> At this Tara and her friends really laughed aloud but somehow Raji did
not seem to notice anything amiss. </p>

<p>"He was saying something about eating baji" Raji continued.  "I
think he said that because I told him something about drinking water
when I called him."</p>

<p> At this point everyone shouted "April Fool Raji." </p>

<p> "Oh!" said Raji smiling a little sheepishly. "It was you people. I
thought it was Mandar."</p>

<p> "Boy! I think that was the best April Fool trick of the year" said
Mala and everyone agreed including Raji.</p>

<p> The girls concluded phoning Mandar will not work. They decided to
write him a letter.</p>

<p> "Tara, write me a poem for Mandar" said Raji. </p>

<p> "What about the poem you wrote about gentle face and kind eyes?" Tara
asked.</p>

<p> "I do not quite like it that much" said Raji. "I want something
nicer."  </p>

<p> "Raji, what is nice is not the words but your feelings. I am sure
Mandar will like to hear that in your own words."  </p>

<p> "Please, please, please. Write me a poem."   </p>

<p> "Okay, if you put it that way, I will try. What should I write about?"  </p>

<p> "Just write about his gentle face and how I like to think about it."  </p>

<p> So Tara sat down and penned a poem for Raji and read it aloud: </p>

<p> "Title:  In love with my solitude. <br/>

I love my loneliness because of you. <br/>

There is no one around and I can think of you, <br/>

Of your soft gentle eyes, <br/>

and your sweet smiling face. <br/>

I love the silence because of you, <br/>

I can open my heart to you in my thoughts, <br/>

and I like to wonder why you hang on to my every word. <br/>

I need no one else, now that I have you, <br/>

and I am in love with my solitude because of you." </p>


<p> "How does that sound?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "Perfect" said Raji.  "That exactly says what I want to say. I will
write this down and leave it on his desk." </p>

<p> So Raji wrote the poem down neatly in a pretty piece of paper and she said: </p>

<p> "I will address it as Dear M and sign it guess who. Let us see what
Mandar will do. He has to guess who it is correctly. He is under test
right now." </p>

<p> "What if he does not guess it is you?" asked Tara.</p>

<p> "Then I am going to lose my temper. I will hit him on the head with
his stupid bag." </p>

<p> Tara and Raji went to Mandar's classroom early in the morning. They
recognized Mandar's bag and kept the paper on the desk and
waited. They watched from a distance. </p>

<p> And to their surprise they saw Mahesh going to that desk and picking
up the piece of paper and reading it. He looked around and he saw Tara
and Raji standing at a distance. Mahesh thought it was Tara who wrote
that letter for him since it was well known that Raji was crazy about
Mandar. Mahesh was really happy and he gave a bright smile. </p>

<p> "This is bad" said Tara. "Mahesh thinks that letter is for him. Our
chemistry is just not right. He will get hurt. What do we do now?" </p>

<p> Mahesh send another smile in Tara's direction. </p>

<p> "Raji, do something" said Tara. "This just won't do." </p>

<p> "Do not worry" said Raji. "I will set it right." </p>

<p> Raji went over to Mahesh and said: </p>

<p> "Mahesh, that paper is for Mandar. I wrote that letter for him. Please
give it back."</p>

<p> "Oh, this was for Mandar. So what do you like more, your solitude or
Mandar?" </p>

<p> "Does it sound like that? Well, Tara wrote that poem. Tara surely
likes her solitude more than anything else." </p>

<p> "You better write Mandar's name down." </p>

<p> "I will change the Dear M to Dear Mandar but will leave the guess who
as it is."  </p>

<p> Raji then  wrote Mandar's name on the letter. </p>

<p> "Mandar is going to be very happy" Mahesh said. </p>

<p> "How do you know?" asked Raji. </p>

<p> "Well, he is crazy about you. He has been thinking about how to talk
to you all this time. This makes it easy for him." </p>

<p> "Really, then this letter is not necessary. I will just
wait. Knowledge is power. Thanks Mahesh for telling me this. Moreover
promise me one thing. Do not tell Mandar about this letter. This is
going to be great." </p>

<p> "Why should I help you girls? You did not write a poem for me?" </p>

<p> "Just because you are nice." </p>

<p> Raji knew that would take care of Mahesh.</p>

<p> "Now I can tear this letter" said Raji.</p>

<p> Just then a school supervisor surfaced. This supervisor was known to
be tougher than the rest. </p>

<p> "What are you people doing?" asked the supervisor. "I am sure you
are up to no good. What is that paper in your hand Raji? Give it to
me." </p>

<p>  "Oh, it is nothing. Nothing. Just some scribbling."  </p>

<p>  "Hand it to me" said the teacher. </p>

<p>  The teacher then read the poem out aloud and said </p>

<p>  "So this is what you do with your minds? You are supposed to be
 studying. You should be thinking math, science, and social studies
 all the time. That is what your parents send you to school for. They
 should know what you are all up to. I am sending a letter to your
 parents to come and see me. I will send a letter to Raji, Mandar,
 Mahesh, and Tara's parents. Kids nowadays have no sense of
 discipline. We are going to the dogs. What is happening to our
 society?" </p>


<p>  "Why do you have to trouble our parents? Keep them out of this" said
 Tara really concerned. </p>

<p>  "No. They should know. They should know what their kids are up to.
 Expect a letter next week."  </p>

<p> The teacher disappeared with the poem down the hallway.</p>

<p>  "We are dead" said Tara. "My father will kill me." </p>

<p>  "I got Mandar into trouble too" said Raji.</p>

<p>  "We are all in trouble" said Tara. "You yourself are in big
trouble. All you can think of is Mandar. Are you for real?" </p>

<p>  "I did nothing" said Mahesh. "I am okay. Am I glad that poem was
not for me!  I am glad that poem was not for me. Glad, glad, really
glad."</p>

<p> "Technically Tara is okay too" said Raji.  "So is Mandar. I do not
care. I will think of something by then." </p>

<p> But everyone knew that no one was okay. Parents would not
understand. It did not matter whether they did something wrong or
not. They were all in big trouble.</p>

<p>  "Next week is going to be a rough week" said Tara shaking her head.</p>

<p> But as luck would have it, Liza was going to the staff room to hand
over some composition note books and she was walking behind the
supervisor. Liza saw the supervisor drop a piece of paper and she
picked it up and was going to hand it to the supervisor but she met a
friend and she stopped to chat.</p>

<p> Finally when Liza entered the staff room she heard the supervisor say:</p>

<p> "I do not know where I put that poem. I have to write letters to Tara,
Mandar, Raji, and Mahesh's parents. I wish I had that poem in hand. I
just do not know where I placed it. It might be important to have that
proof."</p>

<p> The supervisor continued to look in her bag and among her books. Liza
soon guessed that she had that paper. No way was she turning in that
paper. Tara was her friend. </p>

<p> Another teacher said:
"It is better you do not write without proof. The parents will not like it.
What will you do if the students  say that they did not write any poems?" </p>


<p> "But I already warned them that I am going to write to their parents"
said the supervisor. "I have to do this to keep my face." </p>

<p> "I suggest you better find that poem then, even before you think of
writing that letter" said the other teacher.</p>

<p> Liza heard all this. She quietly placed the books on a table and
rushed out in glee.</p>

<p> "Here. Here. Here. I have something for you Tara" said Liza handing
the paper to Tara.</p>

<p> "This is just great" said Raji.  "The supervisor is going to look
real silly soon. Serves her right." </p>

<p> Just then Mandar turned up with Mahesh. </p>

<p> "Mahesh told me that we are in trouble because of a letter you wrote
me?" Mandar asked Raji. </p>

<p> "I am sorry I dragged you into all this" said Raji. </p>

<p> "I am more worried about you Raji" said Mandar. "I can handle
this. How about you?" </p>

<p> But to everyone's surprise Raji suddenly became very quiet. So Tara
told the story about how the letter is back with them now. </p>

<p> "Let us destroy this letter before it brings us more trouble" said Tara. </p> 

<p> "Can I read it first?" asked Mandar. </p>

<p> "No. You can hear about the contents from Raji." </p>

<p> Tara quickly tore the letter into tiny pieces and got rid of it. </p>

<p> "That was good timing" said Liza. "Here comes the supervisor." </p>

<p> "I am excusing you all this once" said the supervisor. "I do not want
to catch you people doing things like that again." </p>

<p> "That is so kind of you" said Tara. "We are sorry. We will never
write poetry again. We promise." </p> 

<p> "That is good. Keep your mind on studies." </p>

<p> After the teacher left everyone laughed. The supervisor's magnanimous
attitude was hilarious. </p>

<p> "Tara, How could you make false promises?" asked Liza. </p>

<p> "It is quite alright" said Tara. "I kept my fingers crossed when I lied." </p>

<p> "Then it is okay" said Liza. </p>

<p> "Alls well that ends well" said Mahesh. </p>

<p> "Raji, Come and see me after school" said Mandar. </p>

<p> "May be" said Raji.  </p>

<p> Raji was clearly shy now. The school bell rang and it was time for
class. Everyone went to their respective classrooms in a hurry. </p>
