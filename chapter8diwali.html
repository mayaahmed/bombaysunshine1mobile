<h3> Chapter 8 </h3>
<h2>Festival of lights</h2>
       
<p> It was a pleasant evening during Diwali. The houses lining the
 streets looked radiant with the lit lamps at the doors and
 balconies. Tara and Jaya decided to go for an evening walk.  They
 spend a lot of time admiring the kandils (lanterns) of different
 shapes and sizes hanging from different houses. Kandils were also
 called stars because they were fashioned after stars people put up
 for Christmas. </p>

<p> Jaya and Tara reached a little street corner and there was a huge
kandil hanging which said Happy Diwali and Happy New Year.</p>

<p> "This star got the prize for being the best star in our colony" said
Jaya.</p>

<p> "It looks really nice" said Tara.</p>

<p> It so happened that Surekha who was a friend of Tara from school lived
near the prize winning star of the colony. When she saw Tara she called out </p>

<p> "Hey, Tara, you must come up here. You have not visited us for Diwali yet.
Have you forgotten all about us?" </p>

<p> Surekha was dressed in a silk sari and standing among the lamp lights
in her veranda she looked very pretty.  Tara and Jaya 
went up to Surekha's house. </p>

<p> "You look pretty in a sari" said  Jaya.</p>

<p> "It is Diwali time. It is dressing up time" said Surekha grinning.</p>

<p> Surekha's mother brought some ladoos and karanjis for them to eat.</p>

<p> "Aunty, I am so stuffed with ladoos and karanjis. Can I eat this later?"
asked Tara.</p>

<p> Sure enough the girls had been eating all day. Every where they went
during Diwali people offered them sweets and snacks. Surekha's mother
packed the food and gave the packets to Tara and Jaya. After the girls
took leave of Surekha, Tara said </p>

<p> "Diwali is karanji time in Bombay. It is strange that they make ladoos
always but karanjis only for Diwali as far as I know."</p>

<p> "It is amazing that these ladies who we meet so rarely care for us so
much and are so kind to us'' said Jaya. "They are so happy when we
visit them and they are so eager to feed us goodies. I think Indian
mothers are really a nice lot."</p>

<p> When they got back to their building Chintu and his friends had
already gathered in the common maidan and were busy bursting fire
crackers.</p>

<p> "Didi, you must watch this. Now we are going to burst rockets" said Mani.</p>

<p> Mani put a rocket in a bottle and burnt the top. The rocket went up
in great speed and it burst high up in the sky scattering colorful stars
for a little time.</p>

<p> "All the other fire crackers are baccha (kid) stuff. Rockets are the real
thing. You must try bursting one Didi" said Mani. </p>

<p> Tara said "I am not brave like you kids. So I will only watch." </p>

<p> "You can burn these phool jadis" said Chintu. </p>

<p> "That I can do" said Tara and she held the burning Phool jadi in her
hand and made fire circles with it by waving her hands.  Soon the
older boys of the building gathered and it was time for the show of
the day. They had a long string of fire crackers called Laxmi bombs and
the bombs burst one after the other for a real long time. The sounds
were deafening and Tara and some of her little friends sat with their
ears covered all through that din. </p>

<p> "I do not know why people like that noise. It is bothersome" said Jaya. </p>

<p> Suddenly a group of eunuchs came to Tara's building. There was a new
born baby in the building and the eunuchs always came to ask for money
when a new baby was born. </p>

<p> "Where is the house where the new baby is born?" asked a  eunuch. </p>

<p> Tara was scared of eunuchs and she just pointed to the house on the
fifth floor and she saw the eunuchs go towards the house. </p>

<p> "I am out of here" said Tara running back to her house and standing
outside the door of her house. "If the eunuchs come back I
will run in to the house. I am really  scared of eunuchs."  </p>

<p> But to Tara's surprise when the eunuchs reached the house of the new
born baby, they settled down on the floors in the Veranda. A couple
of eunuchs played drums and the men of the house started dancing with
the eunuchs. </p>

<p> "I never thought regular people could be so comfortable around
eunuchs. They do not appear that scary any more" said Tara really
surprised. </p>

<p> "They sing so badly'' said Jaya. "I do not understand why they have
to clap their hands when they talk. But you are right. May be they are
not so scary."  </p>

<p> "I am going to go and find out what the eunuchs are like" said Tara. </p>

<p> "A minute back you were running scared. Now you want to know
them more"  said Tara's mother laughing. </p>

<p> "I am not coming. I am still a little scared" said Jaya.</p>

<p> So Tara went to the fifth floor where the eunuchs were singing and
dancing and she stood and watched. One eunuch winked at Tara and made
a circle with his thump and forefinger which was a compliment for being
pretty. Tara  smiled back and to her surprise she was not afraid
of eunuchs anymore. </p>

<p> And since the family in the new born baby's house did some elaborate
ceremonies which involved eunuchs, Tara saw the eunuchs again often.
But now Tara smiled and waved them a hello and one of the eunuch would
make a circle with his fingers every time he saw her. Tara smiled back
and this provided great mirth for Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "Tara makes the weirdest friends" exclaimed  Tara's mother.  </p>

<p> "I find them weird no more" said Tara quite seriously.  </p>

<p> Tara then wrote in her diary:  </p>

<p> "All one's fears of another class of people stem from not knowing about
them. One can hate, look down, or fear only if we do not know someone.
The best way to deal with hatred of a class is to make a friend in that
class. Then you see a whole new world. This Diwali which is a festival
of lights, I am glad that I conquered my fear of the eunuchs of Bombay."  </p>
