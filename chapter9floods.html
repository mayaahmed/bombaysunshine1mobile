<h3> Chapter 9 </h3>
<h2> Bombay monsoons </h2>
        

<p> "Wake up Tara" said Tara's mother. "It is time for school." </p>

<p> Tara sat up on her bed with her eyes closed and said </p>

<p> "Hold on a little longer sweet dream, <br/>

and let this slumber that brings such sweet joy, <br/>

last a little longer."  </p>

<p> "You will get late"  Tara's mother said. "Get up silly girl." </p>

<p> "Okay, here I put an end to this dream. Your wish is my command, my
lady." </p>

<p> Tara then jumped out of her bed and looked out of the windows. It was
raining heavily. Tara like all girls loved the Bombay monsoons. She
ran to the window and put her hands out to feel the water drops. Then
she ran to the veranda to feel the rain better. Some of her friends
were also out on the veranda watching the rain.</p>

<p> "It looks like the school is going to be closed" said Jaya.</p>

<p> "You never know" said Tara smiling impishly. </p>

<p> "Of course, one never knows" said Seema sarcastically. "Especially
if one likes wading through the floods and getting drenched in the
rain."</p>

<p> "I am going to school anyways" said Jaya smiling. "I do not want to miss any
classes." </p>

<p> "Me too" said Seeta. "I would not want to miss any classes either." </p>

<p> "Me too" said Tara. "Don't you know I am quite studious?"</p>

<p> Soon Tara, Jaya, and Seeta started walking to school. Seema came
running after them.</p>

<p> "Hey, wait for me girls" said Seema.</p>

<p> "So how come Miss Sarcastic is going to school?" asked Seeta.</p>

<p> "Just because I do not want to miss any classes. If a bunch of morons
like you decide to go to school in spite of this rain the school might
just not close." </p>


<p> The girls wore rain coats to keep themselves dry. But raincoats were
no use against Bombay monsoons. They were quickly drenched. Tara and
her friend stepped cautiously feeling for man holes with their feet.</p>

<p> "If you fall into a manhole, you go straight to the sea" said Jaya.</p>

<p> "I heard that you go to the sea through the drainage systems" said
Tara. "What an awful way to die!" </p>

<p> "Don't talk about death now" said Seeta. "It scares me."  </p>

<p> When they reached school the watchman at the door said that the school
was closed for the day.</p>

<p> "I knew school would be closed" said Seema. </p>

<p> "Well, nothing to do but head back" said Tara. </p>

<p> The girls lingered at school for half an hour and chatted with all the
brave souls that made it to school that day. Then they slowly walked
back home. Their school bags, books, clothes were all dripping
wet. The girls cared little about getting wet. They really enjoyed the
rain. </p>

<p> When Tara reached home she saw Kajabi and her children. </p>

<p> "What are the kids doing here?" Tara asked her mother. </p>

<p> "Their house got flooded" said Tara's mother. "So Kajabi brought the
kids with her to work today." </p>

<p> "Every year it gets flooded" said Kajabi. "I hate the monsoons." </p>

<p> "They must do something about the drainage system in Bombay" Tara's
mother said. </p>

<p> The rain was lashing against the houses and the roads. Warm sensuous
monsoons of Bombay. People wrote poems about rains. There were
hundreds of movie songs about the rains. Tara's soul felt exhilarated
by the rains. On rainy afternoons her mother would roast peanuts and
she would tell stories. She would cook red rice and beans with
pepper. Tara loved the monsoons. </p>

<p> But not everyone loved the rains. The poor of Bombay surely did
not. Their houses were flooded and they sat with their heads and
bodies covered with plastic sheets taking shelter in the stairs of
some buildings like the street dogs and cats.</p>

<p> "I do not want to think about it" said Tara loudly to herself.  "I
want to be happy."</p>

<p> Tara took the kids to a nearby store and bought them chocolates. But
late at night Tara wrote in her diary.</p>

<p>  Title: Guilt. <br/>

Walking on the road and suddenly I see <br/>

a stray dog hurt and bleeding, <br/>

and I know there is not much that I can do, <br/>

or let us say that there is nothing I will do, <br/>

and yet the only feeling I feel is guilty. <br/>


Guilty, Guilty, Guilty. <br/>

Oh this is the feeling that's constantly with me. <br/>

Whether its a lonely child weeping aloud, <br/>

or a hungry little cat trying to housebreak, <br/>

Guilty is all the feeling I feel. <br/>


Why don't I feel angry or sad? <br/>

Why don't I feel like doing something? <br/>

Why do I feel so helpless and down? <br/>

I feel more helpless than the victims themselves. <br/>



I would shrug it off and say I did nothing <br/>

to add to this plight, <br/>

Oh wont you get away far from my sight? <br/>

As long as I do not see I do not know, <br/>

and I could go on living in bliss. <br/>



Why am I guilty to the sorrows of the world? <br/>

Is it because I am not sharing the mood? <br/>

Or is it that I am not sure that I am not involved? <br/>

Whatever the reasons one thing is sure, <br/>

This guilt is something that is hard to get rid off.
